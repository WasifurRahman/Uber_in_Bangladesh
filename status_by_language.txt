Another devastating service from Uber My younger sister called for a ride from mirpur to sadarghat yesterday while pick up from her location suddenly driver disagreed to take the trip in the meanwhile my sister is on the car with her baggage my sister didnt make any urge with the driver 01787178313 and let him go 2nd she make another request and get one car to move to sadarghat lunch terminal this time one diver name kader 1970708810 came and picked up after going to agargao unfortunately the driver informed he won t go to sadarghat and max he can move to gulistan he will go to sadarghat in one condition at 1500tk so in this situation there s no alt way to urges with that son of a and my mom also staying in that car so in this situation what a customer s can do specially when she is a female If uber continue this kinda bull shit service that day s not so far to see the down



Hi just want to know if any Promo Code has been provided this week TIA





I think this group is only for the discussion related to UBER Not for Other personal Offers Am I Wrong



Today I have requested an Uber ride to go to Gulshan 1 from Mirpur Bangla college Luckily i got a driver When I called him he asked my location and said that he is in Mirpur 1 which is far from my pick up location Though it is not so far from Mirpur 1 to Bangla college Also he told me that he doesn t have much gas So asked him if this is the case why did he accept the request then he said right now he didn t wana go I asked him to cancel the request but he refused to do so So i didn t cancel the request and wait for him to do so Few moments later the driver called me and he was talking very rough so i told him that i will complain about him then he cut the phone and cancel the request Then in true caller I found this when i search with his number Sorry I cant share the car no or his image First time very bad experience with Uber



Can any one from this group tell me what is the process of using uber I haven t used it yet Its urgent

My uber driver came all the way back from his home just to hand in a trip fare which he forgot to mention in the fare logbook No matter how rare or uncommon honestly and professionalism may be in this alien city it s a breath of fresh air to know that someone like him strives on I stood in humility as he said goodnight before peddling away back home

Off topic post why this kind of people use groups like uber users of Bangladesh and travellers of Bangladesh is this a new invention of them to harass girls this is what i have got today morning So irritating and shameful in a way that these two groups are much popular and i do believe gentle educated and decent people s are the members of these kind of groups but i was totally wrong I just don t understand what they are gathering from the words education and manner This is 2017 and yet we girls are getting this kind of offensive message from strangers Profile link https www facebook com taskin ahamed

Yesterday 24 June 2017 Saturday I traveled from Bashundhara Shop Mal to my home First I asked CNG 3 wheeler they asked Tk 250 Then I call UBER Servuce was Excellent and the driver was very good I am really happy with UBER

This post is only to create awareness if U ever come by this scumbag be ready to have like experience



I really don t see the point of being so engaged with UBER for so many FALTU reasons Vi rey it s not taxi neither it s alternative It s plain and simple help for Money If u have enough get on or else please find regular transportation Btw my favorite transportation is rickshaw don t think of me as a rich spoiled brat 😁😁😁





It was my first ever trip with uber I requested the trip from gopibagh 3rd lane to Uttara house building Initially it was shown 706 BDT I started my trip and reached my destination After that driver told me it s taking time to calculate the fare due to network issue He asked me to pay the charge that was shown initially that is 706 BDT I paid that and after some time the receipt shown 170 BDT I called the driver and he did agree as well that the charge is showing 170 BDT He said he called uber and they said this is due to some technical issue The charge will be adjusted soon and customer will get the message as soon as it is solved I am not sure what is actually happened Just wanted to know If this is correct or not

This has come to a point that even being tired and sick health wise I am still writing to write this to someone who runs Uber Bangladesh Today my wife requested a ride from Uber from my in law s at TejkoniPara Given below is the driver s information who picked us My wife me and two of my children 1 and 3 On our ride with this beat up crazy looking dirty vehicle which kept on shutting off and on when I felt very unsafe with my kids The story begins Riding on a cow cart UNFRIENDLY smelly Driver Driver constantly on his cell phone using un welcomed languages in front of my kids shouting on his phone and then hits a CNG scooter from behind as he was concentrating on his Cell phone Once we got going guess what The car breaks down and wouldn t start This driver was this arrogant that he wouldn t bother to even inform us anything but instead shuts off the Air condition locks the doors Windows and gets out of the vehicle I somehow was able to unlock the door got out and then All he says You guys will have to take rickshaw and shows me the cash out screen which says 200 Take Are You serious Even if that was a brand new Mercedes Benz I wouldn t pay 200Taka for a 4 K Distance with an a who le driver like this one So I decided not to pay him to make it an example or tech him a proper lesson on what he should or shouldnt do Now my main and final question How come there is no option or emergency contact number for the biggest taxi company in the world I was a daily Uber customer until now Sadly I sold my car as I trusted Uber to serve my purpose









How about using uber on Eid days I d like to know about the availability of the cars Any insight



I am always confused about uber distance calculation and pricing Just look into my arrival place And in front my arrival place there is an U turn I really don t need to go that long and come back And for that my charge is coming more This is ridiculous Please FIX the APP There has to be a manual calculation system

Uber well described here pretty similar in our country





Is there a helpline number I can call for Uber in Bangladesh I need to report a driver and also ask for him details I am looking forward to take some legal action against him Thank you



My driver told me that his last trip a rider requested him and despite heavy traffic he responded he will come He is really hardworking has high ratings and goes above and beyond for every rider Imagine his frustration when upon arrival he calls and the person informs that they forgot to cancel and just took a rickshaw home Such selfish and idiotic behaviours by riders need to be addressed as well Needless to say I took his phone and made a complaint against that moron If you can t be civil don t leave the house

My wife had a very weird and shocking experience with Uber yesterday She had called Uber from Jamuna future park Her destination was Mirpur 1 She was not that much familiar with the way to Mirpur 1 as she not a regular passenger on that route Without noticing her the driver went just opposite to Mirpur i e towards Abdullahpur Suddenly she had found that she is in Azampur She had asked him that why they were on Azampur The driver asked her that where does she wanted to go though she had set her destination to Mirpur and told him several times that she wanted to go to Mirpur 1 Then he U turned the car and started arguing with her unnecessary things It was already 10 pm at the clock and she became too much afraid and disappointed Then when in front of Airport the driver asked her to get down from the car and pay 500 takas She just gets down from the car and fortunately there was a police sergeant nearby She had loudly called him and fortunately he listened to her She had explained the situation to him and asked help from the police officer to manage a vehicle for her He managed one and she came back to home safely She was too much disappointed and disturbed so not able to take any action against the drive without just handover him to the police sergeant We have informed about the incident to Uber More than 12 hours passed but Uber still not replied anything to her So far I didn ’ t have that much bad experience with Uber till now except some drivers arguing unnecessary things and one driver cheated me once I never complained about those incidents as those are very natural behavior for most of the service providers in Bangladesh Still now I have a very good rated passenger 4 8 that means most of the drivers are happy with me But yesterday ’ s experience was highly shocking We still do not know the motive of the driver According to me here are the cases 1 The driver actually didn ’ t understand where to go He just drove in his own mind and trying to force her to get down from the car when noticed that he had made some mistakes If this is the case then the right behavior would be to accept his mistake and drop anybody to his her destination without any charge definitely 2 Intentionally he had done it thinking she is a woman so I can fraud her and forcefully charge some money 3 He might be had some other things in his mind I am really worried in this case I am following the Uber users of Bangladesh group posts and seen the dramas happening there There are some people who are arguing for Uber in such a way that Uber is paying monthly to them just for attacking people who are reporting any bad experience Also there are some people who are highly against Uber We have to keep in mind that Uber is just a multinational company who is offering a service to us If we do not use their service properly i e if we are about to misuse their service it will bring no good to us We have to act in such a way that we could keep our security and safety first not Uber ’ s profit or the car owner ’ s profit Uber and car owner ’ s only allowed to be profited if they can be committed to our safety and security Otherwise you have to leave like your CEO just resigned yesterday I have experienced several drivers who do not behave properly to the passengers and don ’ t know how to use the map They have no training Owners just buy a car and without noticing any points to the driver they just handed over the car I personally trained several drivers how to use the map and behave properly to the passengers I think this is also the drivers who would suppose to train the passengers how to use the Uber properly Without proper training they can ’ t able to do it It might need only a day to train the things to the driver But nighter Uber nor the owners wanted to take the responsibility I think there are so many untold stories about passengers humiliated by the Uber drivers They are not that much tech people to post in social media If we do not concerned about these issues now Uber is going to be another Sinbad ’ s old man to us for sure very soon

Problem 1 the driver received my ride request and immediately started the trip without picking me up Problem 2 after a while when I called him he sounded sleepy and talked a bit harsh Problem 3 As the trip has started already and I couldn t cancel it I called him again requested the driver to cancel the trip Cause I couldn t call for another ride Problem 4 after all these hassle I received a receipt amounted the base fare Problem 5 while tried to give feedback to Uber I couldn t find any relevant scope in their app Don t spare saying u didn t lose any money so why do you complain I believe this is a problem to share at least whether it is operation or technical

























When a man opens a car door for his wife it s either a new car or a new wife So if you need new car from Port please inbox me car MODEL and then I will give you feedback

Not a knowledge post Not an Uber expert Ekta personal example dei One day I requested for an uber as usual the driver accepted my request and met me at the pick up point This was in January or late December 2016 The car was Honda Civic 2016 Interior was modified Before that ride I used to get cars like proton saga perodua axia myvi etc These are good cars don t take me wrong Here s the conversation Him Hello Sir How are you Me Hi name Fine How are you Him I am fine Sir thanks Me Great car Him Thank you bole rakha bhalo je Uber driver ar rider er moddhe ekta chat howa uber er policy er moddhe pore Me If you don t mind me asking Sir he was a senior do you work for uber on regular basis Him Haha no not really I work in T Mobile Former employer of Dell and a few other company Me WOW Ki ar korbo eto shundor gari The Conversation went for a while Him after reaching the destination You have a promo free ride Thank you Sir SMILES Have a great day ahead Me It was my pleasure I use uber at least twice a day back in KualaLampur Almost every driver I got takes uber as their part time job Never felt someone who was illiterate or lacks manners The reason of sharing this post is that the most of the drivers in Dhaka are actual drivers and we all know the how educated they are I am not uneducated people are bad or sth These drivers drive the cars which cost over 20 25 lacs DO NOT expect them to treat you as their family or the way they respect their boss Do not expect them to greet you with a smile Don t expect them to master the uber driver app or the maps You call for the ride you get the ride why bother talking to them without any reason Uber is a blessing in a city where people on buses have to stand on each other all day everyday Keep complaining and maybe one day uber will pack up and go away



Was trying to get a hold of an uber after quite an exhausting day Same hour few days back i paid a fare of 110 tk from farmgate to mohakhali dohs Well all i can say good old days 😠











The main problem is we haven t yet understood the concept of Uber and its service 1 Uber isn t a Taxi service provider It s a technological solution to connect the Rider and the Vehicle It can t be compared with CNG Taxi services 2 Uber is cheaper than Taxi Cab but officially costlier than CNG But if you can be a little tricky you will be able to get promos always And sometimes it will be even cheaper than Rickshaw 3 Even a Car owner socially well renowned person can driver uber He doesn t need to be a driver by profession So it s better not to treat them like cng your own driver 4 We can t call a CNG from our phone We can wait on the road for hours bargain and begging them to take us But expect your uber to reach at our doorstep in this insaned trafic city justified We should be cooperative them too 5 Uber doesn t have a complain Hotline You can report any any issue with the mobile app They are very careful about these and take actions in short time I am telling from personal experience 6 Uber is a value added lifestyle service which gives us ease and comfort to travel And its a blessing in this City where we scarcity of public transport Uber should educate both Driver and Riders cz its a new thing in Bangladesh Lets Be grateful for what we have Otherwise Almighty might take it away too There might be problems in the system and system can be rectified too সব কথার শেষ কথা ভাল না লাগলে use কইরেন না যাদের ভালো লাগে তাদের use করতে দেন। এমনেই দেশে ভালো কিছু হয় না হইলেও যদি পিছনে পড়েন কেম্নে কি ভাই বোনেরা

This wretched guy took a 4 times longer route ofcourse ignoring the uber suggested one from collagegate to mohammadia housing limited where my 38 week pregnant wife was on her way to home from medical checkup with my mother Since my mother is new in Dhaka and my wife was not feeling well so I suggested them to remain silent about the route and to pay as much as he demands over phone really a helpless of me sitting in the office and hearing about mother and pregnant wife s 2 hours long agony Then the second surprise was given by uber themselves I complained and asked for a refund on 7 june and then sent 2 more reminders but they just closed the complain without giving any single reply Wow Is it a new version of Thugs or it is the real face of uber

Hi i want to hire a car from mohammadpur to gabtoli bus tarminal As per the process i picked the destination and Uber showed me the map which is quite unusal Instead of taking the straight road they are suggesting a long road Is that malfunction or do they have any other rules Since i know that i will take straight road n the driver will prefer the same Please help me understand

Till now I didn t face any major problem except কই যাইবেন পুরান ঢাকা অইখানে যামু না কেন্সেল করে দেন I can t get over this I try to ignore this question but some drivers literally force me to tell the destination Today I called a car from Basundhara city and he accepted my request then when we were entering the car then he told me bhai puran dhaka jabo na I left the place I didn t have any food after fasting just because of the car and he denied then j faced the same problem with 5 6 cars and then I took rickshaw and came home



Uber what the fuck s wrong with you Standardize your service or it won t be long before you pack up and leave







If there is apparently so many conflicts between passengers and riders why can t UBER just come up with a solution like arranging CCTV camera on the dashboard inner rearview mirror In fact UBER may require car owners to install such camera and proper video storage as part of official contract What is the limitation of this theory



Hello could anyone provide me a promo code Help would be much appreciated Thanks

After paying for the ride to home the driver was calling me at midnight As I slept so could not receive so at the morning at 7 the driver called again I thought I might have missed something in the car thats why he is been calling I receive the call After receiving the call the driver instantly claiming me that the cash I have given yesterday was tore in middle of the note O o which was impossible because while giving I saw it clearly MY question is if he found the note problem than why he did not claim on that day why will he call me at midnight or the other day claiming me in this by threading that He know my house address so he may come and show me that after me no passengers rode his car dn that he is been calling me only by claiming me about the money issue Yesterday while coming home I felt something tricky on his behaviour but later wise i thought maybe he is just being general to me but today at the morning when his call came in this way I was stunned Did anyone face this issue Is there any rules of a driver to claim for money issue after paying off and mainly on the next day after payment



















Okay so now it s time to open my mouth Yesterday a fake id named Jahangir Alam posted a status in this group where he tried to explain the real story behind the UBER driver and Shanta Ghosh controversy That post made everyone confused and brought a twist in the situation Idk whether that was true or not but that made everyone really very confused Me a member of this group and a regular passenger of UBER was also curious like everyone to know the real story At this moment the confusion is increasing as the driver and the victim both are silent and letting the situation get worse Shanta Ghosh mention in ger post that she made a recording of the whole situation of that day If she could post the video or audio whatever it is I guess everything would become clear and the driver could ve been punished for his deeds So in the comment box I asked her to post the recording as I was curious like everyone to know the real story See what her replies were She started giving me threats Like wtf is this She also said that she didn t ask for any justice or something like that Then my question is if she doesn t want justice and the driverr to be punished then why she s letting the situation get worse Another thing I m not supporting anyone in this case Just like everyone I also wanted to know the real story and the controversy to be stopped But she gave me threat Wow Can I know who s giving her this much power that she s openly giving threats to others on social media I guess it s high time to stand together about this matter guys Let s see who can beat the unity if all of us stand together

Max discount upto 100 per trip is the lamest offer by uber Offering 60 70 discount but it can not exceed 100 tk 😂







This is UBER SMS of 50 discount whereas maximum discount amount upto 100 taka The declaration is making conflict on percentage of discount vs value discount Uber basically applied 50 discount on maximum 200 taka trip fare if it is more than 200 taka than 50 not allowed it will be calculated on maximum 100 taka discount How many users are availing exactly 50 discount The ratio is very law as maximum users trip fare is more than 200 taka so they are not getting 50 discount Here Uber key announcement is 50 but actually it is 100 taka discount Two types of methodology uses for one promorional communication Would any one pls share the communication is comply with govt law or not







The driver didn t have to wait and the behavior with the driver was polite and no chitchats in the car and even then both drivers gave 1 One payment was made via card another by cash When do these stop



is it possible to prebook a ride for tomorrow in a specific vehicle type or seat capacity what are my options if traveling in a group of 8 TIA



Upfront fair 270 TK Skip destination 155 TK It s always better using the Skip Destination Trick and choose the shortcut route unless there s huge traffic It s now common that even if you use Upfront most of the time you get charged more due to technical problems or maybe Uber does it intentionally They are good at doing fraudulent activities all over the world

Can anyone tell me why UBER isn t working at new dohs



I would love to see Grab coming to Bangladesh Then Uber will have a run for their money



There is always another side to a story According to the driver the passenger was constantly kicking on the seat from the back was threatening the driver and calling him names and when asked for the fare he was replied with ভাড়া তোর গো ভিতরে ভরমু I think at this point anyone would ve lost their temper All these because the driver refused to take the trip any further and wanted to drop the passenger at that location The driver denied anything about putting his hand on the passenger But if he did it is definitely a punishable crime After I read her post last night I believed it instantly But later on I thought to myself just cause it s a woman complaining we shouldn t believe it straight away We should also try to know the drivers side of the story So I called him and asked I have the call recording too It s not like he s a regular professional driver He s a teacher who drives his own car in uber and speaks surprisingly decently But that doesn t make him a saint either After listening to what he had to say I was genuinely confused which story to believe And then I saw the passengers comment telling us not to contact the driver and not to bring a driver to a users group Which honestly in my opinion was shady Technically he s an Uber user too by the way Doesn t matter if he s a driver but he is using the OFFICIAL UBER DRIVERS APP I m expecting hateful replies Thank you

The driver called me after half an hour later the trip saying Uber made some kind of technical mistake and the corrected fare is 300 taka more He was asking for the additional fare gently Any suggestions



























I need a educated uber driver payment will 20 share of profit Driver should polite smart challenge driven Call 01670900858









i used uber for the 1st time yesterday for 2 times it was really too good drivers were good nd the car also thnx uber

Happiness is getting money back from Uber



















































I suggest you share your Uber ride code to near and dear ones so that they can track your ride Also talk to them when you are in car so that uber driver can understand that this ride is tracked by some 3rd party This will avert impending danger if any



Just an observation Seems there is a pattern growing with UBER drivers they start using slangs as soon as riders refuses to cancel May be they have found this as an usefully strategy to make most of the rider uneasy and cancel the ride This behavior is getting viral among Uber drivers May be they are using this tool cz Uber officials ignoring this slang using technic and its spreading





i had almost 50 rides with uber and highly satisfied with their services Expecting more better services in upcoming days hope uber already working on it to satisfy our needs and demands rock on uber 👌

Yesterday Two drivers received my request and overphone they denied to go Very funny

May be the longest ride in BD 😂😂😂 GPS Blackout



As salamualaikum I would like to know whether the driver can see the pickup location before accepting a request for a trip Yesterday I requested driver for a trip A driver accepted the request and then after few minutes I called him to know where he was he mentioned that he was at Shahabag My pickup location was Dhanmondi I asked him why did he accept my request if he was not nearby He told me to wait at my place Obviously it is not possible to come within 5 mins from Shahabag to Dhanmondi with so much traffic jam in the road I told him I am on rush as I need to go to university quickly He then told me cancel the request and he kept on arguing that the drivers can not see the pickup address before accepting the request Finally he did cancel the trip It s sad to see such a driver car has a rating of 4 7





Watching a lot of positive comments







Is there any contact number of uber bangladesh I want to complain about a driver This driver took the trip and when he called i asked him will he go to the destination i mentioned and he agreed after 15 mins he called and said he cant go then i said him to wait for 5 10 mins so that i can contact uber and let them know that my driver cancelled the trip exactly at that moment the driver started behaving roughly with me and used slang i said him i will complain to the authority about this and he still misbehaved and said do whatever you want he dont care i said you can lose your uber job he said he dont care this is his car not uber or anyone s father I believe uber authorities should not allow stupid and nonsense drivers who are sick and ill mannered

It s his first week Very polite and soft spoken I wish I could give him more than 5 stars for his behavior thought I should share it for we re always up above to post the problems not such well manners of the drivers



The driver is supposed to turn on the trip after picking up the passenger My trip request showed failed and look what i have found accidentally apparently this driver completely disregarded that and turned on the trip even before picking me up Please make sure to check that trip is not on before u get on the car

Something our law and order should look up to



I have 6 rides where promotion not working due to Indian currency mode Check my profile where country is Bangladesh Anyone help me why this issue happened



Easy and old solution every Uber car should have a CCTV camera which will be recording each ride





If you guys don t Boycott Uber for few days then Uber will not take any necessary action for all these unwanted incidents Now it s up to you if you want solution then just Boycott Uber Otherwise just think its a regular issues get habituated with it







Uber s Travis Kalanick Announces Leave Of Absence Company Adopts Harassment Policies June 13 20171 23 PM ET BILL CHAPPELL MERRIT KENNEDY Uber says it s making changes to address a culture that was blamed for tolerating sexual harassment and other misconduct Uber made two big announcements Tuesday adopting new policies to improve its workplace environment and saying CEO Travis Kalanick is going on a leave of absence for personal reasons Kalanick said he needs time to grieve the recent death of his mother The ultimate responsibility for where we ve gotten and how we ve gotten here rests on my shoulders Kalanick said There is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve Kalanick said he would be working on a team that could lead Uber 2 0 But if we are going to work on Uber 2 0 I also need to work on Travis 2 0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve he added The statement was included in Uber s note announcing new policies that are meant to help it fight sexual harassment and change a corporate culture that has been blamed for allowing workplace misconduct to flourish Uber s board unanimously accepted former Attorney General Eric Holder s recommendations for improving the company The first recommendation in the report according to a 13 page summary is titled Changes to Senior Leadership It calls for some of Kalanick s duties to be reallocated and emphasizes the importance of the company s plan to hire a chief operating officer Other recommendations ranged from improving accountability and training at the company to bolstering both Uber s human resources department and its employee complaint process The plan also calls for increasing diversity and establishing a version of the NFL s Rooney Rule that would require Uber to include at least one female and one minority candidate in hiring for jobs and to include a woman and or a minority on hiring panels As Uber released details of the plan to its roughly 12 000 employees Tuesday Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey said Implementing these recommendations will improve our culture promote fairness and accountability and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated While change does not happen overnight we re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees riders and drivers The need for a new approach was highlighted by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler who published a blog post in February in which she said that she was sexually harassed at the company and that both managers and the human resources unit ignored her complaints In response to that and similar accusations Uber fired 20 employees including senior executives and reprimanded 40 more employees Those moves came last week after an outside firm was hired to investigate more than 200 misconduct claims against the company as NPR s Yuki Noguchi reported Another recommendation in the new plan calls for Uber to forbid any type of romantic or intimate relationship between individuals in a reporting relationship It also calls on the company to prohibit the consumption of alcohol during core work hours and to ban the use of controlled substances The final item in the summary that Uber released Tuesday calls for a review of the company s pay practices to make sure it complies with state and federal equal pay laws The new plan is emerging at a time of turmoil for Uber s top executives Its president Jeff Jones quit in March after less than six months Later Tuesday a comment about women reportedly made by board member David Bonderman at an all staff meeting drew outrage There s a lot of data that shows that when there s one woman on the board it s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board board member Arianna Huffington said according to leaked audio published by Yahoo Finance Bonderman then interjected Actually what it shows is that it s much likely to be more talking The New York Times and the Washington Post also reported on the comment Bonderman has reportedly apologized in an email to staff Uber s PR team later reweeted a Times reporter s post with an excerpt from the apology where Bonderman called it a disrespectful comment and saying I deeply regret it Thanks to an aggressive growth strategy Uber now operates in cities on six continents Valued at around 70 billion it s one of the largest private companies in the world But its reputation has suffered over the harassment reports and the company has also faced challenges to its labor and competition practices as well as a lawsuit from Google s parent company over its self driving vehicle program Here is how NPR s Aarti Shahani described perceptions about Kalanick after news of his leave of absence began to circulate Monday We really don t know too much about this yet but a couple weeks ago his mom died in a boating accident and his dad landed in the hospital — so I mean really horrible personal loss And it could be he just needs a break It could also be that leadership is losing faith in his ability to pivot the company The board first announced it had adopted the proposals in Holder s report on Sunday hours afterward the company saw another high profile departure as senior vice president for business Emil Michael announced his resignation NPR uber uberbd uberdhaka

Topic Uber 1 In professionalism there is a rule Client is always right Until you cant adopt that the Client is always right till then you are not a good service provider When client is angry service provider need to adopt it and make him calm down first even though its clients fault Later the service provider can tell him politely In most of the company offers such training for their employees Even those who gives support in telecom companies they gets hundreds of slang languages everyday But they are always polite with the clients just because of they are trained Uber drivers are not trained neither they have any professionalism or responsibility 2 Got some comments that when he is is driving in uber that time he is just a driver Oh that s so cheap mentality He is a driver that doesnt mean you will use slang to them There are many educated people are driving in Uber who is more educated than you Just the thing they don t care how the work is To them all type of works are same I respect such people Personally im a Managing Director of a Group of company but I always sit beside the driver whenever i needed to try uber Behaved like friend Many time i order things online and maximum time i got an educated delivery man Always i call them brother and if senior then bhaia We should respect each and everyone But unfortunately in our society there are huge number of people who cant tolerate lower leveled people they call a rickshaw puller TUI just because of he is lower leveled Then off course your boss should call u TUI

How to use discount code in uber





I have an important message for all the passengers specially for all the sisters after today s incident Please when you feel something is wrong with the driver leave the car immediately Remember if you are in the car you are at drivers mercy Driver might take you to a remote location where it would be very difficult for you to get out 1st just get out of the car at any cost Then if you can try to get the car number for legal purpose Your safety comes first Be safe and please make sure this criminal gets punished other wise we might see more of this type of incidents



I would appreciate if anyone can assist how i can unregistered a car from UBER

























There is a saying Make the customer the Hero of your story When an international company came and start running business we the people expect a change in the service and we believe that this must not be the same as like our country s business gives us Why Because the comapny vowed to make the difference and they make us feel that the goal as a company is to have customer service that is not just the best but legendary Now obviously there are argument that every business has some flaws and there are something which authority can not control But as soon as a complain filed authority must have to have give their utmost priority to solve this problem But sadly we see a very little responses from Uber to create a benchmark which is really disappointing We see a post today where a sister of us faced something terrible and survived somehow from something worse and it could be be more worst than this but luckily she managed But how long a girl need to think about their own safety in their every bit of life This is the time to solve the problem and make a scenario where we can assure our girl that you are not alone in the road as soon as a customer start journey with your Uber service you are the liable authority to take every single situation It s your responsibility to make our girl feel safe otherwise you need to simplify your service with saying Only for the Male We want service like Uber so please keep it in your mind that It s easier to love a brand when the brand loves you back

One of my friends is looking for a driver to drive at Uber If you can help please inbox me Car location is Segunbagicha TIA















Uber is getting horrible day by day This evening my 2 years aged nephew faced an accident He got 5 stitches on his chin So when I was coming back to home I called an Uber But the driver called me and asked me about the destination After knowing about the destination he just blew out on the phone like আমি যাব না। উবার কি নৌকা পাইসেন নাকি যে যেখানে ইচ্ছা যাবেন। দূরে কোথাও গেলে যাব নইলে যাব না। I told him that Uber is bounded to give me ride at any distance And I m carrying a little injured boy But he replied উবার শিখে আসেন আর যাই শিখেন। কমপ্লেইন করলে করেন কিছু যায় আসে না। And he just disconnects the line He didn t show up nor did he canceled the ride Instead he continues the trip and ended the trip after a while I was charged without having the trip This is outrageous I saw many posts regarding this kind of behavior from Uber drivers But looks like Uber doesn t care enough Because we re not seeing any actions against those drivers Maybe because of we re posting only in social networks People have right to know about it Who knows maybe someday these outrageous drivers will beat someone to death I work for a news agency I ll definitely cover this one tomorrow in news And will request all of my friends in news media to cover this I couldn t record the whole conversation because I wasn t expecting this But I recorded a part of it

Almost everyday I face the same problem that is the driver gives me 1 star I usually do not talk to divers if there is no any urgent issue I am a daily user and I use to and from the office In many trips when I got out of cars I see my rating is being decreased I don t understand why driver gives me low stars Today I came from Mohammadpur to Kamalspur Railway station my bill was Tk 230 after discount of Tk 101 I paid him the bill and said thanks but he left 1 star He was telling me that you have awarded 101 Taka discount I guess he was indicating to pay some extra but I didn t pay anything extra and that is why he gave me 1 star As a regular user how we can get rid of this type of harassment

I m going to first time riding to Uber How can avail a promo code plz suggest



Yesterday I had the worst experience with UBER We took this trip yesterday afternoon and the cash payable amounted to 65 taka Even as per all my previous experiences with UBER i gave him a 4 star after the trip was completed before paying him But the driver claimed that his system is showing a total bill of 665 and refused to show us his receipt saying the receipt can t be shown twice He started making a scene He kept on saying make a complain in UBER If I am wrong you will keep your money back He claimed that what s being shown in my system as a receipt is wrong and apparently he haggled with other customers with the same issue before At the end we had to give up and paid him 665 instead of 65 only Seems like Uber is turning into a goon service

Late Post Called this driver and he shows up after around 40 minutes No idea of navigation and I had to keep on checking if he is standing still somewhere Very bad driver as I was horrified when he hit a man riding cycle and when I asked him how did it happen he said that he was honking but the man did not give side and that s why he pushed him by the side of his car But honestly it was more then a push serious injury could take place Request all of you guys to avoid him and stay safe























Is there Uber allowed to pick up from inside airport











From Panthapath to Gulshan fixed fare shown TK230 But after completing the trip I was charged TK515 including TK100 discount There was heavy jam in street But driver followed the Uber suggested route So I don t see any point not to honour the fixed fare I sometimes use android app uber meter to compare fixed fare with meter fare Even the meter fare would be much less than the amount I was charged Already complained let s see if they resolve

Uber drivers should keep enough changes with them They shouldn t intend to take petty 5 10 tk more in every ride like traditional cng and rickshaw drivers do I don t often go to a restaurant where the cashier takes more from me giving this excuse Be professional It s your business you are supposed to keep the change not me

Seeking attention of this guy s owner Very bad behavior

I don t know what people say about Uber I have recently shifted to Dhaka city I have made 2 uber trip First one was from Jamuna to Gulshan Then 2nd one yeaterday from Gulshan to Karwan Bazar From my experience i am very much satisfied Though it took little time for the driver to come But my journey was good The driver was friendly The rent was within limit and i didn t have to give extra charges My suggestion will be training the driver to be effective and productive Keep moving ahead Best of luck







So decided to travel home from uni via Uber today been waiting for so long and after like 15 20 mins this guy picked up the call even though it was certain had to break fast on road He was so friendly and nice He was saying if it s okay to stop for a min to buy some water and all I already had cold drinks and some food which I bought from uni canteen and I offered him he was shy and reluctant at first but then he had it He even offered me some dates as well and we chatted a lot throughout the journey So people if you come across certain moments where you have to break fast in the middle of the journey kindly do check on your driver as well Do offer him whatever you have even if it s just water Maybe it won t change anything but at least you did something good to someone in Ramadan And ohhh one more thing can I get a promo code It s too damn expensive 3

Yesterday I saw a post about not being able to use the promo code despite applying it I thought it was probably some technical problems But today when I called an uber for like 5 7 times I did not get the discount and no matter what I tried uber just won t let me use the discount left on 9 trips expiring 1st June I really had high hopes from uber as it started off greatly but now with all the technical glitches to misbehaving drivers it feels like uber will also be a flop case I honestly hope that this post will be noticed and the normal public will get the solution to the problem



My ever first bad experience in Uber U can see in the screenshot that he is closer to my destination but he denied it over phone and said he is near to American Embassy Then I told him please cancel then He said no u requested u cancel we can not cancel I said I will not cancel my charge will be deducted He said no Apu no charge will be deducted I answered him that I will not cancel and please stop lying the map clearly shows u r not near to America Embassy He said Apu roja rekhe keno mittha bolbo Kicchu bolar ny And now I took a Cng and didn t cancelled yet And will not cancel How come he ended up with a 4 start rating

Hello Uber Users Greetings from Admin Panel This is Walid Something that has been brought to my attention that after taking action against some people in the group some of you have started to abuse the Admins and their Families Let me clear few things for you guys We created this community so people can share their experiences and thoughts in here People can help each other out THIS GROUP IS NOT FOR BUSINESS PURPOSE The company we work in has nothing to do with this group It is pointless to go to the page and give one star We always said that we are just like any other Uber Users We don ’ t have the luxury of time to reply to each and every query We don ’ t know all the information that ’ s why we never tried to give out any information We agree that some of the individuals were really helping out but when they started giving out wrong information Uber reached out to us Now it ’ s up to you to decide if you need wrong information or you need right information from the officials We are still not saying all the information would be according to your experiences but those are how Uber works Now we and the Uber officials we all would like to keep this group as a medium of sharing experiences feedback issues and criticism not for misinformation or malpractices Saying that I ’ m leaving this group Happy Ubering

Dear uber user how can i use promo code for discount











There is a serious problem with this driver At around 1 10PM he accepted my request When he was at Rampura Bridge He said to me that he will drop a passenger at Banasree and after that he will pick me up I told him that I ’ m waiting At around 1 17 he dropped the passenger who was on the ride and I got notification on my mobile that he is arriving Then I called him at 1 45PM he told me to wait for 10 min I waited and I saw in my uber apps that he went to south Banasree which is far away from my home Then I again called him at 1 55PM this time he said to me something which I didn ’ t understand and switched off his phone I called him again and again he was out of reach I checked in my apps that he crossed Banasree and through Hatir Jhil he went to Dhanmondi and at 2 33 PM he was in Lalmatia Area Mohammadpur After that I got notification on my apps that driver had canceled the trip at 2 34 Guess what was he doing in between this time Why he kept me waiting for 1 hr 24 min and canceled the trip after that Does uber call it a professionalism Here s some screenshot 😠 BTW I did complain to uber about this and waiting for there reply on it Will keep you updated

Looking at so many negative posts about Uber in this group I always wondered how have I not had to experience anything bad so far But that is history My recent experiences in Uber last 1 week has been nothing short of terrible It s as if only the worst behaving and most unprofessional drivers are left in Uber now Here s the story of my recent experience So I request a ride and I get him Mr Asheque I see he is on trip and see that the drop off point is actually very close to my pickup point So I call him when he gets near the destination and he confirms that he is almost there and that I should get to the pickup point and I comply So after reaching the pickup point I call him again to let him know that I am here But this time he tells me that the current passenger will actually return and he will not be able to pick me I tell him that he can t do this in Uber and that I can complain about him Then he starts misbehaving and tells me that he will not pick me up So I ask him to cancel the ride which he refuses I tried to tell him that since he is the one who is unable to pick me up then he should cancel not me In response he starts shouting and then disconnects I call him back and this time he says and I quote Ami cancel korbo na Apni chaile boshe thakte paren Ami ei jatri ke namai ashbo So yes Basically I have decided to not use Uber again in BD

WORST UBER EXPERIENCE I am a regular uber user but today s experience was the horrible one This guy switched the uber app off half way in our trip It was a round trip and so we went to kolabagan from karwan bazaar and returned again He turned off the app and asked us for the same amount on our return trip He even asked way too many questions to my colleague when i was not in the car This was the most annoying driver It was a toyota succeed If anyone knows the owner please aware them that this guy is stealing by turning off the app and doing trips

This is really disappointing and frustrating regarding Uber in BD Its just beginning of this service here but getting too much irritating sad frustrating news Service Behaviour Fare Policy which really un expectable Uber service should take some initiative to guide Uber pool driver in terms of every aspect And we riders obviously handle the all situation polite and smartly though I know sometimes situation goes beyond control I think in near future riders vs uber driver collaboration will be very fine in BD Hope for the best Note Outside of the country we got the Uber service very fantastic in every aspect

Can we have a partner database maintained containing the phone numbers used in the uber car It would have been easier to reach them if their drivers did some really terrible thingy Most of the times the partners who use drivers may be unaware of the fact that their drivers are arrogant and end up losing a profitable business in the long run







I m not being able to call another uber for this Although I have paid 220tk to the driver The driver was complaining about some system errors in his phone Anyone knows what s wrong

Uber service becomes more horrible day by day 2 drivers refused to pick 3 drivers were at CNG pamp keeping their uber software on Last one who came after 15 minites after taking CNG complete the ride and provide 1 Note that 46 minutes has been wasted to find a Car

Highlights of the first 180 Days of Uber in Dhaka 1 Average ETAs have been as low as 8 mins for almost 75 of the trips 2 Morning 8am 10am and evening 6pm 10pm have been the most popular Uber hours of the day 3 Airport road BRAC University and Gulshan 2 have emerged as the most popular Uber destinations in the city 4 A single driver in Dhaka has taken 1671 trips 5 A single rider in Dhaka has taken 391 trips 6 We ’ ve seen a diverse bunch of driver partners from big fleet operators to a single car owner who drives full time to professionals from telcos and banks putting their cars on Uber for some additional income to students who ’ ve taken up driving on weekends to earn extra pocket money 7 Besides using Uber as a regular mode of transportation for office commute riders in Dhaka trust Uber for their early morning trips to the airport and choose to Uber after late night dinners with friends or family Above all women riders in the city have welcomed Uber as it gives them the freedom of mobility and assures them a reliable ride at all times SOURCE UBER Press Release





Any idea why fare is like this

Uber driver talking over phone while driving Illegal and risky

What to do with this credit

I got this message today at 9 26am but when I call Uber and I used it at 4pm today They didn t give me that discount Driver said that it s not available now Any idea abt it

Uber didnt provide any promo code this week Last week i travelled over 15 time Whyz that









I used Uber in Dhaka for a week and talking to drivers it seems that many riders expect the car to be there within 5 minutes of calling and many users cancel if the car is not there by then Please understand that Dhaka traffic requires a minimum of 20 minutes of patience for the driver to get to you

this is the 2nd time i got refunded earlier i had a very bad driver complained and they apologised with refunding 🙂











How to get this discount









Ride was good Willing to give 5 star But at the end of the ride driver told me to give him 5 star showed me that he gave me 5 star What should i do now Give him 5 star or not As because he made a mistake by telling to give him 5 star indirectly blackmailed by showing me that he gave me 5 star 😶😶

Yesterday I ve faced two types Problem in two times At morning this driver Montaz already on trip but that time I m on my way to uber Though he accepted it was his mistake

Some answers that you might be looking for regarding Uber s upfront fare system Q The fare in the driver app is more than Upfront fare am I being cheated A Most probably not Upfront fare is determined by the optimum route and expected time taken based on traffic conditions In a place like Dhaka where traffic is very much unpredictable and the optimum route might not be available due to closed roads or other reasons the actual distance and time taken might be highly different from what was used to predict upfront fare Hence the final fare at the end reflects the new parameters a process known as fallback Q If I was promised a certain fare then why did Uber revise it A As explained above a revision was necessary because of change in the important trip parameters i e distance and or time taken Since the driver has served you throughout the journey this is to make sure he is adequately compensated for the extra duty time gas cost that he incurred This being said the upfront fare is honored in most of the cases it falls back only to reflect exceptional circumstances Q Will I get a refund if I complain of high fare A You are eligible for a refund only if the driver deliberately took a very inefficient route while a much simpler one was available Fare increase due to high traffic change in destination from the one entered detours or multiple stops is not a valid case for refund Please use the option of refund wisely as you are impacting the daily income of the driver for reasons which might be beyond his control Q What should I do as a rider for the best experience A Please enter the accurate drop off point as destination Ask the driver to follow navigation Many Dhaka drivers aren ’ t very well versed with smartphones and use of technology and take a certain time to learn please be patient with them Pay the exact amount shown on the green screen at the end of the trip that is the fare amount attributed to the driver In case you feel there is a real error by the driver or the GPS then report it to Uber

Recently i have seen a lot of debating against the admins for a person called Nafis Yes i agree he might have done a great job helping the users and guiding them to use uber in an effective manner I also can t avoid the issue bought by uber against Nafis I have visited Nafis s profile and it looked to me that it was a fake one Now would you please tell me whom should i believe an authentic post from the Uber representative or a fake profile named Nafis Hasan From the beginning the people of the group asked for an Uber official and now when the admins of the group collaborated with the officials and when the officials bought some issues of misinformation to the people everyone is overreacting Uber authority is now trying to help the people with the exact and authenticated information so that both users and partners can get better service Instead of appreciating the help of Uber we are quarreling over a person who has a fake profile Do we even know Nafis Hasan in person I am not taking anyone s side here All i am requesting is we should give this new situation some time to settle down and refrain from taking drastic decisions out of anger and emotions

অ্যাডমিনদের সকলেই সাধারন উবার ব্যাবহারকারি এর জন্য শুধু মাত্র উবার থেকে পাওয়া তথ্যই এখানে শেয়ার করা হচ্ছে। Estimated Time of Arrival Roughly translates drivers may take upto 1 hour to reach out pickup point Only request a ride when you have about 1 hour time in hand for pickup As most Uber riders will already know on average in Dhaka you will see a ETA for pickup of less than 10mins At Uber we pride ourselves in providing a convenient and reliable option of transportation and expecting or encouraging riders to wait upto 1 hour for pickup is not aligned with the Uber experience As we grow our footprint across the city riders can expect to see their ETAs going below 10mins since time of request

UBER should advise drivers not to pick up riders and then expect that they will oblige to take a detour to a CNG station I requested a ride today The car arrived some 20 minutes later All was well for about half a km and then the driver lets me know he has to refuel CNG I was heading to work on a holiday because there was an urgency So I had to get off and pay 70 tk for a ride that took me 500 meters from my home Not cool







This driver denied to go my destination But received my on call and and press on drive still I am waiting What should I do I couldn t cancel the trip











From Jahangir gate to Bijoy Soroni Upfront fare was shown 106 but fare came 190 There is only one road no scope to deviate the route

Dear All Uber Riders I found that most of the riders are complaining about the drivers and some of you post with images and slangs I am requesting you please change your thinking Most of these drivers are from rural areas and also most of them are uneducated but you are expecting them to act and behave like executives Please don t post such things which will effect these drivers bread and butter If you found anything wrong please correct the driver and help them to understand what he have done wrong if possible advice teach them as much as you can Complaining and FB posting is not the solution We all Riders and Uber drivers need to help each other to make a better service Hope we all can make some difference in the Uber service with our small small affords Regards

I have already taken 8 rides successfully Yesterday it was 9th Square hospital to shiya masjid I started my trip by asking to follow the path that uber suggested Driver followed Driver and car s condition was good I thought I will give him 5 star I asked driver is it rant a car or personal car He replied rant e car He informed sometime he rides for uber and other time he took over call trips মন চাইলে uber e চালায় according to him So finally I reached my destination and paid my cash It was 115 but I gave him 120 and thanked him After reaching at home I went to give him star and found oh he already gave me 2 My average grade was 5 start but it became 4 6 I was disappointed as from the begging I was 5 star Finally I also gave him 1 Have I done any wrong







Last line says “ If pickup dropoff location or route is different from UFP suggested then actual fare will greater than upfront fare This is mis leading information since actual fare may be higher OR lower than UFP depending on pickup dropoff location route and travel time For example if distance traveled is much lower than UFP distance then actual fare will be lower than UFP fare It also mentions no matter how long you stay in traffic the fare will not change This is absolutely untrue and creates dissatisfaction among riders due to which they enter into arguments with the rider and do not pay them the full amount due

Hello Uber Users of Bangladesh Recently some of the Admins of this group had a chat with the Officials of Uber Bangladesh about Uber in general and the community that has come about through this group and they were kind enough to provide a statement for all the members of this community

Someone care to explain me this I checked the fair from 2 different phones of my friends and I got different fare results I restarted app again and again checked it was the same for each of the phone The location I selected was exactly same for both and I did it at the same time of day and at the same exact place

How can I see my own rating provided by the Uber drivers

Why don t you have split fare option yet



Without any reason the driver gave me 1star Why I want an explanation How can I get that



This is my personal collection Though it is not maybe 100 correct but I follow this list and I am happy Happy Ubering

Why wasn t I charged the upfront fare which was showed before the ride 🤔

Important new law for car

Took a trip of approximately 5 5 kilometers this evening Trip recipt shows travelled distance as 0 and trip fare was lower than the upftont fare If reported does the driver partner gets compensated

This asshole refused to come at my pick up point and asked me to cancel When I politely refused to do that and told him to cancel as its his fault this driver still put me hanging You can see the time difference from my screenshots

Uber rating was 5 All was well I didn t know Uber discouraged to TIP So I stopped to give to Drivers TIP last couple of days I used Uber 6 Times And I did not give them any TIPS I stopped to give them nay kinds of TIPS Everyday I was checking Uber ratings When I stopped to give Tips From That day ratings started down Every time its getting down I never talk with driver most of the time Driver ask me I usually answer I know how to maintain courtesy There is no chance I misbehaved Uber drivers My suggestions please change the ratings systems ratings systems will be another way Uber can add in this way to give them feedback Otherwise I think So many people will stop to use UBER And Also I am thinking of uber uber user fedup







As you know that we had to take action against couple of people for providing misleading information creating rumors and spreading bad practices that hurt rider driver ecosystem We will post all the wrong information they have provided sequentially You are requested not to post or share anything created by those people Thank You All

I had taken uber while returning from BICC Intially it showed Tk189 while requesting uber but the driver showed the fare was Tk500 Can anyone please explain this

8801792050540 Driver Nazir Avoid this driver if you have alargy listening to abusive words and slang Other than that the trip was fine I think ladies should skip taking trip with this driver I have such bitter experience after a while now I must say incident number is decreasing which is a good sign or is it just me



Bad Uber Driver Detected Driver s name Thandu mobile no 01771200279 or 01710730810 He accepted the ride request and later denied to come to pick up point He was talking rudely over phone and insisting me to cancel the trip I have denied to cancel and made him bound to cancel the trip And finally reported to Uber against his unprofessional and rude behaviour















what is upfront rate



can do anything for it but driver was good

Today I arrange a uber ride for my aunt since she did not have uber account After finishing the ride driver told that total fare is 130 and ask her to give 100tk According to driver 30tk was discounted But I had 3 free ride of 100tk each I rated that driver 5star before I figure it out When check the bill that was only 25tk Driver lied to her and took 75tk more Is there any way to complain against that driver and get refund

Nowadays quite a few drivers accept my uber request while on another trip sometimes they even ask me to cancel my trip since they are slightly far from my location or because of jam my questions are 1 Why are they accepting another trip request while on another trip 2 Should i be the one cancelling the trip or should they since they are the one with the problem

How can I use my promo code at uber apps It can t write on payment mode









Nafis Hasan vai need attention he is on trip need another hour or so what can i do



How can a driver receive my call when he is on trip











Can anyone please tell me how can I add my email to my uber account I have tried to edit my profile but there is no option to add update email আমি কোন money receipt ও পাচ্ছিনা।











So much love from Uber 😇 😍



Always follow road map as suggested by uber Sometimes driver show less interest but make him to follow the suggested map then how many time u spend on trip does not matter Fare will be just same like as upfront fare



FYI I hope uber will be on

Dealing with uber drivers are nowadays going like dealing with CNGs which is one of the prime reason why people diverted from CNG to Uber but drivers are becoming rude day by day yesterday i requested uber after office as i do everyday got a car with a driver of 4 6 rating which is good usually drivers with such rating are well behaved the car was 10 min away from me as on map with 2 min he called i picked up and got shocked with his first sentence shunen ami dure asi ashte parbo na apne call cancel kore den i said ami to vai dekhte passi apnar location still apni na chaile apni cancel koren he said amader nished ase cancel kora apne koren i said apni to amake cancel korte bolte paren na setao to nishedh ami cancel korbo na erokom e thakbe he then started shouting apne taile reques korsen ken amake ken request pathaisen amake fazlami maren i got angry and said ajib to ami ki apnake request pathaisi ami apnar name complain korte pari he replied eh aise apne ki complain korben ami apner name complain kormu i just lost my words and hanged off he cancelled the call Nafis Hasan vai I had already raised a complaint about this and uber responded with an apology mail thats what they do always an apology mail but Does their apology really can do anything to minimize such incidents





I m user s of Uber few days ago I was in gulshan 1 road 30 was waiting for car coz Uber driver accept my journey gulshan​ 30 to gulistan I watching he was near by me but he was saying he couldn t​ recognise the location then I walked to the main road and was waiting Infront of South East bank Though he couldn t recognising then I walked until Robi office and I found him standing there and waiting And it was sx Carina ac wasn t working well and 1 more I got probox in very bad condition My question is if they don t know how to use map location why they become Uber driver to harassing passengers We are paying for comforting and save time and safety In Bangladesh we have common problem if we start to comfort on any service and when we start to depand on it It s start to low on quality service Coz we are really absorb everything and they use that weakness of ours Please change this mentality Keep the quality and service good Don t harasses us Thanks









Just counted my total number of Uber rides it s 79 in last 3 months and during this 3 months I rode CNG only 2 times Thanks Uber for giving such a good experience y



One of the nicest and smartest drivers I ever had He is a undergrad student ubering part time Liked him very much

Went from Banani to Shyamoli The driver was good and well mannered but the car was a Corolla 1990 Saloon The AC was somewhat okay but don t know why Uber does not have a minimum standard for the cars they provide The car number plate was also a Chatta Metro The numbers did acutally match but still don t know how it got the permit to be in the streets I rated him 4 and placed a note to Uber regarding quality of a car





Today i had my first ride with Uber and um totally satisfied with the service i Got Axio the condition of the car was good enough as well as the driver The ride was from Banasree to Banani nd it just took 16 17 minutes to reach as there were no traffics My bill ws 200 tk I wud rate this service 9 10 thnx Uber 😊

Around how much I ll have to pay If I start my trip from Bashundhara to Pathapth Squire Hospital Actually I use our own car because of some technical issue I can t take our car tomorrow haven t used UBER service before Thanks all

Why do Uber choose the zig zag road red markd whereas Straigt Road is available green mark That red Mark gate at Bashundhhara R a is kept close most of the time Have tried several times but same red mark road is selected by Uber



How can I know if i am on fixed fare or not



Yesterday a passenger requested from a narrow lane where a car get difficult to move and still driver went to that lane and after going the customers say that she cant see the car that mean in correct pickup location after waiting 10 min the rider forcefully cancelled the request by driver and also my car get damaged So here is the uber support message about narrow lane pickup Note i just request to all honorable passenger if there is no such emergency like sick or other please instead of taking car narrow lane select a suitable point where car can go and wait for u I strongly said to driver that whatever the location you must go as possible So if riders and partners we both stay together and keep understanding among us UBER can help us a lot Thanks all

Day before yesterday I requested for a Uber car and I saw that someone picked the call and the estimated time of arrival was 13 minutes I was keeping my eye on the app to see whether the car is moving After about 5 minutes I noticed that the car is not coming to my way rather it is going to opposite direction I thought I should wait for sometime and after 20 minutes I saw that the car went to Gulshan 2 where as I was waiting at Tejgaon I realized that the driver picked the call while he was on trip I called the driver to verify this and found that I was right Asked him why did he picked my call while he was already on a trip He said Uber wants them to pick the call even when they are on trip The app showed it will take more than 25 minutes to get the car so I cancelled the trip Requested again and this time I got a car that was very near to my destination So cancelled the trip again 2 cancellations and didn t want to try the 3rd time I opened Pathao and requested for a ride and I got a rider from Adabor md pur Had to cancel it too Tried one more time and this time I got someone near and after 20 minutes the rider came to pick me Bottom line our suffering didn t end even after introduction of Uber n Pathao We need more such services









Happy Ubering I got my refund









Nafis Hasan vai another bad experience this time upfront fare and bill had to pay made me feel













Amar fare chilo 7tk trip sheshe ashlo 50 The car left rear wheel was smaller than the rest the ride was very bumpy and risky Driver was kinda rude too

Why are we Riders so worried about OUR ratings What implication does it have for us to avail Uber s service We have lowered our standards to the level of half educated drivers Everyday we are posting Driver gave me 1 star and 1 gave him 1 star in return too



My pick up point was there but the driver couldn t make it by his fault Now walking to catch him Uber you made my day





Is there any promotional offer available now

where is my rating showing i am unable to find this

Off topic My top transportation services apps Uber is only for traveling when I am with my mom or other family members or in a group Most expensive but most convenient of the bunch Pathao is for daily commute Expensive for an uncomfortable ride However you can get places quick However getting a ride takes quite a bit of luck In Gulshan area its more available MUV is a better alternative to Pathao You can see riders nearby which you can t with Pathao Really good customer service But the beta app is kinda ugly Needs more work However can t complain since service is good Priced similar to Pathao Amar Ride is really cheap But cheap things are not good and good things are not cheap Bikes are available But rider fell while on trip with me and could keep balance of the bike I had to help Also started moving without letting me get on the bike properly New company still in learning phase Do you use anything else I would love to try it out





I was assigned this Driver few mins back pick up point at Banani overpass towards Banani direction I called him at first he didn t receive few mins later I again called he received and said he already crossed the pick up point so I said him to CANCEL the trip as he failed to call me or receive my call rather he argued and said me to cancel I said why would I cancel as you failed to pick me up then he said don t cancel keep it going in a sarcastic voice as I was in hurry I had to cancel NOW HOW I REPORT AGAINST HIM as I hav no option to rate him this type of driver certainly taking the standard of uber down

He might be a driver with 3 9 star but yesterday during thunderstorm at night he agreed with my trip from mohammadpur to malibagh and after dropping even he did not claim or asked for any additional He deserves more than 5 stars And finally thanks to uber happyubering

Uber is now in google maps







It was a peaceful morning but I was little worried because I ve to carry two small boxes of office supplies and the concern was more when I was connected with a driver of 4 11 rating On board he called someone and talked for a while once finished he made another call and talked for a long time I never like anyone making unnecessary calls on wheel I was thinking to rate him 4 When the trip was completed he rate me 4 without any reason may be for not giving any tips I rate him 3 and mentioned his phone calls to uber Below is the response from them Uber is good but their drivers got to be more professional

My passenger rating is showing none stars today Even a few days ago it was 5 star Is it some kind of bug How do I fix it

Last night uber showed me fare tk 79 from mohakhali to panthapath before start journey but after reaching panthapath the fare was tk 155 I m clueless how this happened Please help me to understand

My uber driver doesn t know the way and he isn t following route what should I do



















Thanks Uber Users of Bangladesh for enriching me about Uber uses Today I take a trip with promo discount with fixed upfront fare no hassle for waiting charges although I was compelled to paid earlier after new circular even But now feeling honored that drivers are not forcing for extra waiting charges But I have an observation regarding refueling It s better to not waiting the riders rather not responding any calls until refueled Because if riders have any urgency they fell problems Like dashboard was showing 7 minutes to reach at pick up point But after 5 minutes when i saw the car was moving anti direction then i made call to diver He replied that he was heading to CNG refueling Therefore i have to cost more 13 15 minutes But i was not prepared for those extra time Consequently my riders were late to reach physician However driver were intended to provide quick service Thanks

I m new uber user nd i dont know how to use the promo code Can anyone help me plz

A little TIP for the ladies who use Uber Specially at night when you are travelling share your location with any of your family member who has Uber installed in their phones Try to let the driver know that someone is tracking the journey I have been travelling in Uber at night lately I just share my status with my father and my husband I make sure the driver knows it Uber is a safe ride but we never know what can happen You can find the sharing option just above the base fare of your ride Staysafe HappyUbering

I had 2 issues today for my first trip the car was 4 5 mins away however the driver refused to come to my place if I don t tell him my destination first The driver canceled the call later In my second ride the driver cancelled the ride somewhere before my drop off point by mistake and at the end asked for 175 taka later on I found out the actual bill was 30 taka after my promo discount complained in both cases how long it may take to hear back from UBER and what type of penalty may the drivers be imposed





I m really confused and talked about this issue previously but since I didn t have the screenshots​ so couldn t get a solution When I requested​ Uber from my office to home today fare was showing 145 GPS is fully on and my smart phone s system is android 7 But when I confirmed the pickup location fare was just changed to TK 505 Can anyone please explain what s happening

Okay now got this message from a different number So are they from UBER really I didnt get that much discount offer before 😲😲 75 off

This is my driver s dashboard from last week My car is a silver Allion with fresh interior exterior and smooth engine performance Air condition and everything is working perfect So the most important factor behind this rating 4 41 is my driver s attitude towards passenger Any kind hearted fellow rider here in this group who rode with my driver I could really use some help Please share from your experience what could possibly be improved I have clearly instructed him not to ask destination never ask for tips never cancel any trips neither by him or by the passenger and always try to make the rider feel like s he is riding his her own car He was instructed to give all the riders 5 star and if there is any situation contact me immediately Though he mistakenly gave his first passenger a 1 star as he did not remember which one was the best and just after completing his first ride I had requested Uber to change the rating to 5 I want his rating to be around 4 6 by next week so trying to find some areas of improvement Thanks for ur valuable time



I don t have any complaints just want to tell that this driver came along with another man when asked told me it s his owner as today his 2nd day at this job he doesn t know well I refused at first then thought it can be true and I proved right later but the thing is was that really needed I also rated him 5 star This AC was also not working btw Can uber officials provide proper training so solve this problem please Thank you

Want to share you my today s experience which is related to Traffic Police They caught my Car near Kazipara My all papers are ok But one officer started to investigating my driver and he also started to talk with my rider Although my driver told him rider to tell the police that he is not rented this car but the rider told the officers the face and tried to leave to spot without even pay anything but later on he paid with the force of my driver But by this time the police officers targeted my driver and asked Tk 1200 accusing that he is violating the law by taking the passenger and Uber is totally illegal He even talked with me over phone Finally as this is the first time my driver gave Tk 700 after consulting with me to get rid of such bad situations My request to all the riders to help the drivers by supporting them against the false harassment of traffic police of Dhaka City helpthedrivers

Nafis vi I recently joined uber as ubers car business partner Since yesterday till today my driver carried 3 rides where customer didn t pay and no money or fare was shown on the drivers mobile apps So my question is how much is the fare for these 3 rides and if these 3 customers r given free rides when we will rcv the money in our account

If your driver select destination where he want to go for that trip you are allegeable for bonus your driver can do it twice in a day





Want to use uber for first time Any suggestion or information or discount







Alhamdulilllah all 3 rides were good Drivers are quite well behaved cars are all new and well maintained Overall my experience with uber so far is pretty good 😊😊 Happy ubering

A bad day of me for Uber At first one driver couldn t come to my pickup point which was easily reachable he didn t follow my direction then went to another way Second driver refused to go as he had gas issue I told him to cancel but he didn t Then I took a CNG Moral is that Uber is really smart but not the drivers are And Uber should provide them proper training or they will lose customer like me I took 65 rides but these issues are not solved yet Picture shows driver is going away but not canceling the ride Awesome





Today I experienced the worst and for the first time I felt like using excessive force on someone which would be an extremely bad example 1 He gave me knowledge more than half an hour because I told him destination orally Eita naki niyom nai Later I entered destination on app 2 In the whole trip he was expressing dissatisfaction as I chose the route shortcut but there s some traffic unfortunately 3 Due to change in plan I changed my destination Concord Police Plaza to Hatirjheel Bridge 2 on app but he refused to take me there and dropped me off 4 kilometers away from my destination He dropped me off 4 kilometers away from my destination Sometimes keeping head cool becomes really tough when someone ruins your day Just complained Uber and wan na see if they do anything Driver s number 8801929725398

This driver is really good Well mannered driving skill is also good Mistakenly I rate him 3 Nafis Hasan bhaia can you help me out hw I change my rating 😣I feel really bad

Hi I need to know how exactly a passenger is rated by the drivers and on what basis My story requested a ride from green road to Lalmatia after 11 pm I guess the driver didn t see the drop off point before confirming because when I told him where I wanted to go he was about to cancel it but then didn t and picked us up We got in the car greeted him and that s it It was barely a 10 min journey My rating was 4 45 before this ride and now it is 4 38 But why And if the drivers don t want to cover such short distances why do they accept the trips

Hi good people In my last ride I asked for a refund of BDT 105 uber gave me BDT 176 Happy Ubering





Used UBER twice today Extremely happy Both the drivers were excellent Didn t ask where I will go until I boarded the car Didn t ask for any tips Rated me 5 star I didn t hesitate one moment to rate them 5 star I didn t have any discussion with them on rating One had misconception on promo code reducing their income Explained him that it doesn t effect their income One partner is driving his own car He is aware that there is lot of negative effort against Uber to fail in Dhaka but is confident that it will survive He mentioned that his income is around 3 750 4 000 per day without bonus and costing is nowhere near to 50

It was my first ride in Uber it was amazing wonderful Thnx to uber authority for letting it happen





Thanks Uber for prompt response

Appreciation post with positivity Always we riders share the negative experience we get from uber today I would like to share a very positive review about the uber driver today I received His name was Islam with 4 5 ratings I saw when I requested till now though I never have faced any bad experience from uber but this evening Mr Islam was the best till now in my uber experience I have rated him 5 star also have put a thanking note for his beautiful behaviour with gentle manner politeness I think we also should share this sort of positive experience so that the positive vibe can spread to explore motivation Good luck uber thank u Drivers like Mr Islam is always appreciating for their manner professionalism





From the first ride with uber I did not take the uber route at all while changing my route uber also change the route according to my route and showed me right path So just check after changing the route uber did change the route to your path does it make sense or I will explain it with a video Today i took a ride from ring road adabor mohammadpur to shamoly raod to kazipara uber showed a the route via chandrima uddan beside GonoBhaban to mirpur road via taltola shawrapara But I took the shortest path via shishu mela 60 feet road while turning to my road uber immediately change the route and showed the 60 feet road in my app as well as driver app My fare Upfront was 153 72 taka after reaching kazipara my fair was 150 taka only Note i do it my way just after analyzing i found it but you should always follow the uber route if you don t know the route I know my shortest route that s why I have changed it the fare can be different if you change the route and don t notice the uber route is changing or not happyuberring

1st ride with uber Driver behave so good fantastic

its really frustrating that in UBER office they are selling WE phn



Off topic I am a regular user of Uber but today I will give you another transportation services name SAM It is a bike transportation by the way 7 6 KM fare is 62tk Every day pathao took 120 130 taka from that route Such oOww Just a review nothing else Happy ubering









Fantastic piece of gesture from Uber I was overcharged on my trip to Office from home Even though the upfront fare was 140 taka I had to pay 235 taka despite taking the suggest route I made a complaint and although it took a few days but they still got back to me and gave me a refund Got ta say I am more than satisfied with their customer service Unlike the CNG mayhem at least at Uber you get to complain to someone and hold someone accountable if you are overcharged Happy Ubering





































Uber gave my money back D













I have taken my 100th ride today It s been good so far But why the hell all the drivers started to turn on the trip before me getting in the car Happened to me twice today Both drivers excuse was boss apnar location a eshe tarpor trip on korsi Keo jodi 15 20 mins wait korai taile ki korbo amra Well that is clearly not my headache There s no point arguing with them so I just finished the rides and gave them 1 and they also rated me the lowest just because I confronted their cheap tactic Is there any new directive from UBER to perform such action

Salaam everyone Yesterday I had a ride by the car Dhaka metro Ga 178928 and drivers name is Shahjahan Shiraj I don t have any complain against him or the car except the fact that during the ride I grabbed the roof handle and instantly it snapped out of its place It was clear that the handle was damaged from before As it happened by my hand unfortunately I will pay for the repair But this is an unnecessary harassment for anyone If the car is not in proper condition it may cause trouble for passengers I hope if there s any Uber official in this group it would be appreciated if he or she clarifies whether there is any rule for this type of inconvenience Thank you

How to check uber driver give me how much rating











This diver is new he was gd at all but at last he asked for tip I said uber doesn t allow I got down after I check I found my rating 3 2 I m shocked after I rated him 1





I m not getting any discounts for the last 2 weeks Is there any problem with my account What s really going on



Hello everyone I am an Uber partner and Uber rider as well Nowadays we are seeing that lot of complain are coming against Uber drivers Most of the time the complain is about is being frustrated because he is getting less amount because most of the time riders are getting discounts Suppose if the original fare is 200tk and rider have 100tk discount then driver will get 100 tk cash So most of the time driver thinks that he has been paid less But the fact is this discount amount will adjust with Uber fare by end of the week and driver will get back that rest of the amount which he was supposed to get from that trip So I believe due to lack of understanding majority of the drivers don t understand that So as an Uber rider we can explain that fact to them Therefore I believe it will reduce misunderstanding between riders and drivers

What does change amount in UBER account mean

Yesterday I ordered Uber and spoke to the driver and told him about the location After 10 minutes he called back said he doesn t have enough gas in his car to travel this short distance and asked me to cancel the trip I said if I cancel uber will charge me and asked the driver to cancel it because it s his inability I called him few times but he did not cancel it I couldn t order another uber because it shows the journey is still on I ordered it around 6 pm but he kept it on till 8 I lodged a complaint to uber and waiting for their response When I put it on FB I found another user also experienced the same problem with the same driver Drivers name Abdul 8801756300559 Route was Bijoy shoroni Banani Chairman Bari My questions 1 Does uber interview the drivers in person 2 Do they give a list of Dos Don ts to drivers 3 Are they educated enough to use the app or read English 4 Most of the time I have to call them several times and give them directions which is an extra cost Don t they have training to use gprs Uber is very useful and handy I don t want it to close down because of the malpractice of few drivers They need to be more strict in choosing their representatives uber uberdhaka







Today I had very different experiences from two different drivers I went to Niketon from Dhanmondi 14 1st one is Mintu bearded middle aged person showed extremely bad manner in front of children and elderly person Also without any reason he gave me 1 The 2nd person is Atikur also bearded but very well behaved driver and also his car condition was great y I was very much satisfied



This driver said he can t come after 15 minutes of waiting So f crazy driver He refused to come when I requested him to cancel he just ignored me Behaviour is so rude Please be aware of this driver

Can anyone give me contact number of uber I need to talk to someone or customer care number is preferred Thanks in advance























I have 2 types of promo referrel promo with long time validity and short term promo like KHUSHI30 However whenever I am using my ride Uber applied referrel promo In that way short term promo will be lapsed Is there any option to select the promo Pls advice

Dear Nafis Hasan is it mandatory to provide credit card as payment method for new users please help

Nafis Hasan please do enlighten us about this cheap bengali behave and do inform uber authority if you can Because we use uber as per the driver rating but the customer rating is usually low because we don t always throw the extra 10 20 bucks in their pocket So as a fact I got somewhere like 4 ish rating but what kind of cheap nonsense is this Usually none of us take the ride if the rating is any lower than 4 or 4 5 but if we misuse everything in our hand like this then no point accepting honesty from the business either These sort of people should be banned from using the service as they lack basic civic sense and also causing problems to other users

Can anyone tell me about this 75 discount

uber promo code needed f s ei week e paini







Connecting to on trip drivers is probably the worst idea that uber has managed to come up with I d rather wait and search for a free car or they can show if all cars are busy so that I can search a minute or two later The idea of connecting to on trip drivers is both a hassle for the driver current passenger and also the person looking for a free car and not to mention the repeated cancellation trouble as well



















any promo code for free ride or discount

















Upfront fare was showing 140 but after completion the trip fare was 180 with promo After that contacted to uber support and today they refund as uber credit Happy Ubering

Today I experienced best uber ride Rider Name was Emran Car was Nissan Bluebird The Rider was very much decent He didn t talk too much And his rating was 4 9 I also gave 5 star He didn t ask for any extra money Hope all rider of uber will be like him









D











My rating was 4 80 until yesterday but it has gone down to 4 63 within one ride Because a driver was taking wrong turns and took over 30 minutes and didn t come to pick me up It was within 3 minutes distance I called him but he hung up on me several times I made him understand my location 3 times but he was roaming around to other places not picking up the phone After watching this happen for over half an hour I had no other option but to cancel that trip because the driver wouldn t come or cancel either I don t even know if he was genuinely lost to pick me up from an easy location of main Kamal Ataturk avenue road but my relatives had a train to catch I don t know if this cancellation lead my rating to fall or the next driver who came in 2 minutes and dropped my relatives at airport railway station gave me bad rating Either way it s sad because today Uber started to send me below 3 5 drivers with old cars with hardly an AC working properly Another one was 3 9 but until today I never had to ride a below 4 driver Why Uber why

Cheated by Driver want refund On last Friday 5 5 2017 at around 4 pm I requested Uber to go from Banasree to Jamuna future park The best route for the route is Banasree rampura badda notun bazar Jamuna future park This route was also showed in uber app Before starting the journey uber app shows me 200 taka for the trip The route that was suggested by uber app was totally clear But the driver provided me totally a wrong information and he forcefully take me to another way I was asking the driver to go to the uber directed route But he didn t listen to my speech and he went to a wrong road The driver went through Banasree Hatirjheel Tejgaon Mohakhali Banani Kuril Jamuna future park I also faced terrible jam in that route In the middle of that journey I thought the driver was blackmailing me I was so much frightened when riding He also wanted to take me Bijoy sharani router At last the driver dropped me to Jamuna future park and billed 350 taka whether the uber app shows me only 200 taka before the journey The driver hadn t listen to my speech not maintained the uber directed route and took me another route I already reported to uber but not received any refund yet It is a precaution for every rider Be Careful Thanks

Since I see around 10 15 negative posts everyday and only 2 3 positive ones here s a positive one Meet Ziaul someone I could not thank enough for his honesty A week ago I d ridden in his car after jummah to banani He talked nicely spoke about how the rating system affects him and the passengers at the same time He complained about how many users are unable to rate him after a trip or that they weren t rating him high enough I doubted his complaints in my mind because many uber drivers have similar complaints so I took note of his behaviour To my surprise I found nothing out of the ordinary He was cordial took my advice when choosing routes and even stopped midway because I d forgotten to withdraw cash from an ATM He didn t even complain about the low fare At the end of the ride I d forgotten my card holder in the backseat and neither he nor I noticed it It was only after the next rider found it that he realised my mistake and called me immediately to let me know I asked him to please deliver it when he came nearby my area and he promised he will I did get it back a week later because he was unable to come near my area before then but I received it without any damage to the cards and without him misusing it I gave him whatever I had in my wallet and he refused to take it but I put it on his passenger seat and ran away regardless since I felt so indebted to him 😝 To be honest a little bit of good behaviour goes a long way I ve seen first hand how some riders treat the drivers It seems they think they own the car for the duration of their ride Yes there are a lot of bad drivers out there but amidst all that there are equally good drivers like Ziaul who get buried because of the bad ones Next time you re on an uber just say hi and ask the guy how his day has been It breaks the ice and makes the driver happy that you re taking an interest in his day If he behaves rudely simply get out and order another Uber for your safety







Opinion Post Somehow I figured my rating is not getting updated properly By properly I ment its getting reduced in a devasting way I can see my drivers are putting 5 star rating for me but I can see my average rating is reduced​ drastically 😑😑 Does this ring bell to anyone Nafis Hasan I m seeking if I can do anything about it Because I tracked for last 4 trips from 4 8 now its 4 44 Although I saw every driver gave 5 😢😢





A bit off topic Is there anyone who can connect me with a driver interested to drive a Uber car with decent payment



Some point of view 1 I saw a good driver who s rating is 4 12 why he has no idea with that but the strange thing is he picked me up for a short distance my fare was on 120 taka from a huge traffic and distance 2 On my second trip I found another driver who was talkative but still I rate him 5 and thanked him for picking me up 3 3rd ride another good driver i gave him 150 taka fare was 145 taka and he return me 5 taka I gave him a thanks and Salam I gave him 5 star though he drove too slow 4 4th ride the driver came a long way to pick me up he did a terrible mistake by using a bad language while talking on a topics and i suggest him not to use this kind of language again he understand and felt sorry for his manner I gave him 5 star with a thanks Now here is the things driver are not literate and most of them don t know how to use map or type any english word how can you expect them to follow the route properly we should help them Also always try one thing when entering into car ask them How are you One good behavior from user side can change the driver mind totally D I hope user should be more patient and UBER partner should be more careful when choosing a driver and trained them very well UBER should improve the app Happy ride share



Positive review I have got a nice ride today The car was a toyota corolla The driver was a gentleman named rabiul He is a professional and knows how to follow GPS He didn t demand for tips They fare was Tk 95 I gave him 100 and he gave me back Tk 5 instantly We have got 5 star from each other Happy Ubering

How can i use the skip destination trick after trip on

after taking 3 rides still my rating is like this Why







i wanted to know as New Uber Driver related all proceedings and benefits Thanks





No skip destination or Enter destination later option Having problem from last night I used Enter destination later yesterday evening But after that when I tried again for another one at nearly 9 pm it shows this From then still I am unable to discover the option Need help from experts





So skip destination is not available now







Requested for a ride this morning After showing En Route he wasn t moving so I called him He was like ow request disilen Then he asked my pick up location and destination He acted like he don t know the pick up point although it was well known hospital Then I described the location After the call he wasn t moving I was waiting After 4 5 min he called and said ashte parbo na onek ghure jete hobe I was shocked He was very near by Then I said that I can see you are not moving at all and you are very near Then he just disconnected the call and cancelled Should I complain to Uber











what is the meaning cash driver canceled and cash canceled



Took a ride this morning to get into office The driver was well behaved and I was nice with him After finishing the ride when the fare was calculated with 40 discount I can clearly read the facial expression of the driver which was indicating that he was not happy at all It resulted in my rating which was 4 50 star before and now came down to 4 11 star I think the drivers should understand that Uber is giving them target bonus and they should not consider the discounted fare or tips while rating riders



Some partners received below mail as new Incentives plan effective from 8th May onwards till further notice My understanding is if someone earn net fare 3000 Uber will make it 3500 but if you earn 3399 still Uber will pay 3500 The partners who got this mail should not depend on incentives anymore I am afraid about Fare adjustment since if I stop my car after income 3000 or 3500 net and later fare adjusted to decreased amount we have to loose incentives

I have rider rating 5 for last couple of months The secret is I cancel the trip for drivers below 4 3 and it works My wife was unhappy with such act But it proved On her first ride she got a driver with rating 4 0 I told her to cancel but she didn t During her trip driver refused to turn on AC said it faulty and asked her to pay not considering the discount When she challenged he said it was a mistake She uninstalled the Uber app after finding driver gave her 1 star HAPPY UBERING U r humble to wolf does not ensure they will be the same to u



The trip took only 12min D although the car was old model i guess the only reason for his low rating I do not have any issue with the car models I actually don t care The AC was working pretty well And also the guy was very good friendly Rated a 5 and got 5 too

I want to go Banani 11 from Baridhara Fare is showing 69taka But I still have a 100taka promo in my account How the additional 31 taka will be settled Will it be settled in my next ride Will look forward to concern person s help TIA









I have completed my trip about 10 minutes ago and I paid 425 tk according to uber drivers account But my phone still shows On trip What I should do now





Last week I raised a complaint as one of the uber drivers refused my destination in a rainy office hour Got the reply yesterday As always uber customer support team is very friendly and open handed to resolve issues which is the best part of Ubering I believe I received a mail as on the screenshot here which is telling that I am supposed to get a credit of 50 LKR i dont know what LKR means though but no credit option is showing on my app till now Do I need to do anything to add this credit Attention Nafis Hasan













Today I cancelled my trip immediately after the driver assigned due to his poor rating But Uber app showed me that I will be charged for this a bit Then once I requested for my ride again ended up showing that same driver My question is 1 Why I am charged a bit as I cancelled my ride immediately within 5 minute 2 Why Uber assigned that same driver even though I cancelled his ride and there was enough car nearby according to uber map

Please let me know who provide the best vehicle tracking service in Bangladesh Thanks in advance





I know this might not be the place to ask but I wanted to add my own car in Uber fleet Which is a 110 Corolla 110 SE Saloon with 14 Serial I talked to one of the Driver today he was saying it s really hard to get 3 trips in a day with old serial numbers People cancels that all the time Is it really possible to make 5k after giving the salary of the driver On different note It s high time Uber should categorize the Cars to UberGO UberX and others



This driver forced me to cancel da trip Nafis bhai pls suggest I wan na file a complain He was on cng pump dat mont as well as asked my destination

Why rider ratings are so important Ratings are a two way street at Uber and its 5 star rating system helps them to create a positive experience for everyone But many riders forget that their driver is also rating them too and things like eating in the car slamming the door or trying to pile in more people than seatbelts can impact whether it ’ s a 5 star experience for drivers To give riders more visibility into how drivers are rating them uber is making some changes in their app so that rider s ratings are much more accessible in the app Now a rider ’ s rating will be displayed right under their name in the app ’ s menu

I have started my journey with Uber as a rider and later I became partner Beside my busy business I am observing Uber activities very keenly Indeed Uber is a blessings for us since there are lot of criticism are there Actually we have no scope to divide partners riders as well as drivers since we all are representing Bangladesh Showing my all respect to owner drivers It s true drivers group need to be improved mostly We partners should play the major role to develop drivers attitudes my two driver lifetime rating is 4 75 and recently weekly rating is almost 5 Also riders should help the drivers group to improve since they are directly interacting with them Better we all should raise the voice with recommendations to Uber from riders and partners point of views Immediately my recommendation is to stop Upfront system since mapping is not that much effective in Dhaka city I will personally try to raise more suggestions in coming days as rider as well as partner

I don t know whether its possible or not but I have one suggestion to stop disturbances from unusual call or sms and reduce confusion 1 If UBER authority introduce our ID name or number by that we can call to driver and vise versa then no one can disturb any user Like the way mobile operators call or sms us Drivers will see only ID name not number 2 After finishing trip bill may also come in mobile of the user as sms That will make more reliable and reduce confusion 3 The way we chat in msngr there can be chat option User negotiate with drivers by chatting It s just a proposal Pls excuse me if I am not practical or U don t find it a good one

After that incident I am trying to follow rules while I use Uber So today I took the Uber service twice Both of the driver asked me where I want to go and I politely replied him kindly follow the route which have been showed by Uber app The first driver was good enough but the last driver was lil bit rude when I told him that He was saying Google map taking time to show the routes bla bla Even when I gave him 500 bucks he returned me 270 where my bill was 215 later on he was saying he doesn t has any change Anyway didn t ask him anything and Left Ohhh he told me to give him start as like he is ordering me Anyway Uber is here to help us I hope day by day they will develop the service

Yesterday I got ride with this guy Mahabub 8801676933959 His rating was only 3 8 But he is a sober middle class educated middle aged guy He is the owner of this car was an ex shop owner at gawsia market Fate brought him into this business I asked him why he is with poor rating He told me he had no idea why he is getting poor rating despite his good service After a while we found people give him poor rating not to him but to his car Its the 1992 toyota corola se limited He is proud of his car which is old but ac and engine works really fine But passengers seem to hate his old car Anyway gave him 5 star Kudos to the poor mentality of passengers

Uber Partner Experience 2 One of my rider left his phone in my car My driver called me after that and informed me about that I asked him to keep the phone with him and handover me at the end of the day I immediately mailed to Uber and informed them about it Later in the evening I had a contact to the phone owner and found we both have office at the same place Nxt day yesterday he sent me his support staff to my office and I handed over the phone to him After that I also informed uber about it by mail

Be careful of this guy After getting into his car he suddenly told me his cell phone was not working I have heavy doubt whether or not this was his actual Uber car but forgot to check his number plate After telling that I immediately got off the car as it may cause any kind of unacceptable incident Thanks to Uber for prompt response as they provided me with refund

How Uber provide Promo discount to his different Rider Actually I want to know How they select their user for promo NB I noticed they giive offer to them who use uber very less is it true

ur uber experience always depends on driver more than the car if the probox or wagon driver keep the ac run shows good manner to you not ask for tips and drive safely so what else more needed on the other hand if a allion driver keep the ac off shows rough and ask for tips how would u feel so plz focus on the service that u r actually getting not focus on the car cause u r not gon na own that off topic probox is just a car our choice is in which way we like to see it hihihih

So im down to 3 78 from 4 14 after 1 ride Beshi josh The driver didn t listen carefully where i wanted him to park and wait He was 2 roads forward from my pickup point He was 5 roads away from my house and knew the area very very well Then as i was ready to walk there and asked him to stay put He moved back and parked 2 roads behind my house And he kept telling me he is parked behind a blue bus But the bus was actually green in color And funny thing was there actually was a blue bus parked there too I order the rides for my dad i don t use uber in the morning And with the promo and all my dads usually fare is between 80 85 tk And i know for a fact that he never ask for change after giving a 100 tk note



I have already shared the problem My morning trip of today ended with a bit surprise 1 Upfront showed 240 Tk 2 At the end of the trip driver showed a bill of 360 I paid the cash checking my mobile also 3 But later on an another look found that the receipt has been changed same thing happened few days back in another ride

one story from the other side Some people are outright disrespectful and self entitled no matter what the seat they re sitting on

Is there anybody who faced any problem in the Airport both international and domestic terminal

Mr Badal who drives his own car too good attitude at all happyubering

Just awesome such a good person and professional driver Thank you Mr Alamin

What s coming up tomorrow I mean what promotion from tomorrow 😁😁😁







This guy Helal just cancelled my trip just because I did not disclose the destination point His Mobile no is 8801735102536

















Another one Did not get the oppurtunity to get on board He started the trip without having me and then end the trip on his own I lost one of my promo code How to complain

How to check my own rating



So the day ended with an UBER ride 5 driver 5 behaviour Uber went crazy in the rain I skipped destination and the final bill was tk 30 D Good luck continues p













Its first day of my uber ride took 3 rides today and it s a good experience none of the driver demanded for any tips but i have given every one extra 20 taka as tips without demanding because i have discount and i took short rides given every driver 5 star rating but none of them rated me any single star

























today I took a ride with uber as the driver havent followed the suggested route fare was almost 1 5times more than upfront fare after 1 hour of that particular ride I was about to complain about refund at the last stage when I submit my complain a message appear something like we have already refunded the extra amount for not following the suggested route I was surprised because truly tge amount was already credited anyone have similar experience





For the last 3 4 times that I tried to take a Uber ride the route showed was impossible or unnecessarily long And the upfront fare was through the roof partly because of extra long route So I took a cng It seems to me that Uber is killing its own business















Usually my driver does not reject the request Last day someone called but no response Then my driver called him and he replied his child give the call unintentionally​ Then my driver asked him to cancel the call But he denied He told my driver to cancel the call Finally my driver cancel the call and my acceptance rate is fluctuated How I can report to UBER

You should keep your book to yourself Mr Salahuddin This is a users group not a partners group The guy is helping uber users here Doesn t matter if those same information is on ubers website What have you done to help Nothing really All I see is a butt hurt jealous bloke Get a life





Md Manik Such an extraordinary man that after calling him on the first place he refused to go and i felt it was okay Then he kept on accepting my requests for 5 times and did not cancel himself I had to do the cancellations as i was in a hurry which ended up in too many cancellations for uber to handle Such awesomeness Much displeasure

My driver had a chat with some uber drivers sitting around a gas pump apparently they have 12 15hr duty where they just go online close the mobiles have a long ass nap for a couple of hours take 3 5 trips per day and when the car owner asks why earnings are so low they ll just make up some excuse and collect their measly monthly paycheck with a few taka of bonuses I believe the vast majority of poor rated drivers come from this unmotivated and unsupervised population Clearly this business model is a total bust since we have clueless owners dumb drivers and some spoilt riders trying to fit into this rideshare narrative without doing the same kind of research that people do when FB stalking Bunch of Neanderthal rejects





he is denied to come at my place to pickup driver number 8801720388577 driver name mukter gari no ga267821 denied to cancel the trip too amazing uber driver





need a information is it possible to pick by ubar from dhaka airport domestic section

Trip 29 This person kept on arguing with me due to Tk 0 bill I could not make him understand about the discount promo and uber credits Ended up rating me badly

🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘🚖🚘















Uber drivers are smart They won t rate you unless they see that you have rated them first Your rating will be no more than what you have given them If you give less than 5 you will receive less than 5 as well Smart indeed



So took an Uber ride from uttara to taltola agargaon today Good driver well spoken Unfortunately I left one of my mobile forgetfully in the car He called me after 10 min in my other phone luckily which is used for Uber and asked did I leave something a small mobile I said yes After searching bag He came back 10 min after So this guy actually drove 10 min offline back to me to give me back my phone I am just thankful and happy May Allah bless him

Had a pleasant journey with him One of the honest and gentle drivers of Uber He own three cars all three are in Uber and drives one himself Had a lot of chit chat with him He was finishing up a trip when i requested a ride I didn t want to bother him so i waited for his call He called after a couple of minutes that he was coming towards my destination He was roughly 5 minutes away Maintained the route perfectly the air conditioner was working and most importantly he is an excellent driver Thanks to Uber to suggest me one of the best drivers Rated him 5 stars HE deserved it





If any driver carries any illegal goods in his car and checked by law enforcing body What is the guard of the rider

Nobody should pay tips to the drivers day by day their greed is increasing

It was a good ride









Is there any discount or advantages If I suggest someone to use Uber

I didnt take the ride Why is this



So how does this work Almost similar distance less time taken higher fare Is it surcharge

I am a rider as well as a uber partner Today one passenger with his 7 family members inter my car forcefully My driver request him more than 4 person is not allowed He couldn t listen After starting journey from khilkhet he changes route several times and driver follow his request That guy was abusing my driver several times due to traffic jam though the following route was from his request When he came to mirpur then the passenger was very angry abusing and trying to hit my driver due to take more time for traffic jam Today my driver resigned and told me he will never drive for uber I already complained to uber What should I do











Is there any promo code for new uber account I mean before pohela boishakh there was one GET250DHK like Thanks







Dear All need a help Uber map is showing me an alternative route for my destination which is unnecessarily longer can we edit amend the routes

The fare displayed at the beginning upfront fare of the trip holds as long as destination remains unchanged and the suggested route is followed These fares are calculated dynamically based on your pickup and drop off locations The fare considers duration distance tolls and local conditions traffic road blocks etc







I just love this update



is there any rules regarding luggage how much is allowed It s specially important while travelling to from Airport rail station bus terminal thanks







Can anyone please share any promo code





Lucky me his first day with uber and I am his first passenger 😇😇😇 never had a chance to become first at school or college Uber has fulfilled my dream 😇😇😇



Negative review I sent Uber request from Banani 21 and this guy accepted that from Banani graveyard road After 1 min he called me and said he is far away from my location I said I can see you on my map 😑 Then he dropped my call and after a while I noticed he enabled on trip from the beginning I called him and asked the reason He said that Uber auto enables On trip when the car is nearby 😑 Then he randomly wandered about with his car and after a while he stopped the trip I was charged around 70tk and lost my promo Moreover my rating dropped😠









Everyone don t know the rules and rights of a passenger in Uber Is there any one who can write it precisely Or admin can u pls take an initiative Thanks in advance



Previously my rating was 5 yesterday night I took my last ride and now it s showing My average trip rating is None Star Any idea guys especially Nafis Hasan bhai

যাত্রী হিসাবে রেটিং জানতে হলে এখন আর সাত সমুদ্র তের নদী পার করতে হবে না। 🤣🤣🤣 উবার অ্যাপের মেন্যুতে আপনার নামের নিচেই যাত্রী হিসাবে আপনার রেটিং দেখতে পারবেন। 🤓 কিছুদিনের মধ্যেই এ নতুন ফিচার নিয়ে উবারের আপডেটেড আপ্য আপনার মোবাইলে পৌছে যাবে। Why rider ratings are so important Ratings are a two way street at Uber and its 5 star rating system helps them to create a positive experience for everyone But many riders forget that their driver is also rating them too and things like eating in the car slamming the door or trying to pile in more people than seatbelts can impact whether it ’ s a 5 star experience for drivers To give riders more visibility into how drivers are rating them uber is making some changes in their app so that rider s ratings are much more accessible in the app Now a rider ’ s rating will be displayed right under their name in the app ’ s menu

Dear Nafis Hasan Bhai Assalamualaikum Sorry I have another issue today I had a ride from Khilgaon To Shantinagar Popular Hospital at morning 7 14 The bill was 145 BDT after 40 discount it s 87 BDT I had already credit of 195BDT But when I supposed to pay to the driver its shown 87BDT to pay by cash I paid I was in hurry because of a medical emergency But just now I have checked that 87BDT has also been cut from my credit So I have charged twice for the same ride How do I complain to refund the overcharged bill The trip was nice I have given 5 stars to the driver with a little bit tip But he doesn t rate me Whatever I like the trip



Nafis brother curious mind wants to know if a driver accepts a request while he is On Trip is there no way he can cancel the request for the next ride that he has already accepted





This time I haven t received any discount offer although I am a regular uber user Did it also happen with others too I was seriously expecting it

Experience 1 as Uber Partner Last Night my driver had a trip where 390 was charged But because of technical problems bill was not showing in his account and it was showing 233 taka in rider s account and rider paid 250 taka I reported from my driver s app when he came back at 1 30AM In the morning I found u has returned 140 taka to my account already It was my first day experience and Alhamdulillah it was good

On 25th April I used UBER from Gulshan to Mirpu 10 My payment option was marked credit card After reaching at the destination no bill was shown in the driver s device I was in hurry he then talked to some one over telephone and informed me that the bill is 426 taka The amount I paid him cash Next day when I again requested UBER The UBER software says that my yesterday s payment is still due because of the Bank And now before 2nd trip UBER software shows I have to pay cash yesterday s due plus currently charge At last I agreed with UBAR software and came to Mirpur Then I had to pay 2 bill at a time that is 530 taka previous 426 cuarrent 108 although my second trip s bill was only 108 taka Any way I had to pay taka 426 two times in cash that is on 25th and 26th Now I would like to have refund after necessary checking from the end of UBER Looking forward for kind comment and advice

Now Uber says passenger star ratings will be visible prominently in the app To give riders more visibility into how drivers are rating them we ’ re making rider ratings much more accessible in the app Now a rider ’ s rating will be displayed right under their name in the app ’ s menu We hope this update will remind riders that mutual respect is an important part of our Community Guidelines Uber ’ s hope is that this will encourage passengers to stop “ eating in the car slamming the door or trying to pile in more people than seatbelts ” based on driver feedback

NEED HELP I was overcharged as driver didn t follow the suggested route by uber so I complained and uber refund me the extra amount I was charged now it is showing as credit balance this balance is suppose to adjust with my very next ride is there any way so I can skip this adjustment and store it for future thanks in advance

Sometimes as a passenger I don t feel to take the straight route shown in the app due to traffic so I suggest the driver to take another route for convenience so if I don t take the straight route to my destination as shown in Uber app then will the upfront fare will be calculated at the end of the journey or the fare will be calculated as per the route I have taken during my journey Thank you in Advance 😊

Can t see my rating





Don t change your destination once in the ride from the app I changed and got off even before my preset destination today but my fare increased by 50taka





Uber on Google maps











How do I see my suggested route while using uber



From the last two months of my analysis I concluded the theory of Promo as below 1 If you are a new referral user you will get 100 tk discount for first 3 ride in between you will not be entertained by any promo 2 If you have completed your first 3 ride and not use UBER further they will send promo 3 If you a regular user and doesn t have promo you should try to give referral code to your friends and you will get 100 tk off for next 3 ride 4 As long as you have a discount added into your payment by giving reference you will not get any promo 5 As long as you are not stop using uber from your account for a week you are not entertained by UBER So for a Promo give a pause for using UBER then what happen It s totally my personal opinion and calculation based on my personal uses However Happy ubering









Uber is available in early morning in dhaka specially at 4 00 am to 5 00 am

How may I know about my ratings





didn t get promo code so good buy untill get a promo code discount bcoz can not afford such aa high upfront fare

What promo coming tomorrow Any guesses folks

yesterday after my ride from gulshan to dhanmondi the uber driver accidentally rated me wioth 1 star instead of 5 accidentally cause he was rating in front of me and so was I rated him 5 due to this my rating dropped down from 4 59 to 4 44 how t deal with it

I was wondering if Uber stops all discount in the form of promo codes for riders how many of us will use it in day to day life regularly like going to office coming back from office etc Isnt it a bit too pricey Before the fare hike or upfront fare it was still comparable to cng but now without discounts its way too high



Uber driver Edres claim full fare even i had 40 discount on this trip I have made a complain on uber lets see what happen I have showed him the invoice from uber but he refuse and said he didnot receive any discount tips from uber I said i ll pay as per invoice but again he denied It was late at night so i didnot burgain and paid him total We must beaware of this type of driver







What s the point when you re restricted to max 100 tk

All cars in use v

Thanks Uber just got money back Thanks all who helped





How can a passenger check his rating



Upfront fare as customer





I ve travelled to Apollo Hopital from Middle Badda today morning It was 7 45km distance with 25 46m and upfront final bill were 215 tk But at afternoon travelled from Apollo hospital to Middle Badda It was 6 42km with 01 05 31hr due to huge traffic and upfront fare was 243 tk but final bill came 380tk I couldn t understand why it was happened If upfront fare is variable due to traffic so why it was not affected when it tooks less time like my morning ride I ve attached both fare chart please have a look and you ll see the clear difference i e fare chart of 215tk is not elaborate like fare chart of 380tk For your kind information from last 4 months I ve followed the same road like today









This is exactly what is wrong with uber they are telling me to take mohakhali flyover tejgaon link road satrasta moghbazar mouchak rajarbagh komlapur arambagh motijhil route no wonder passangers and drivers don t want to follow uber route also drivers use google map which shows different route than uber map the more I travel in uber the more I realize the uber fixed rate is nothing but hoax

Again I face the same problem dear concern pls solve this issue immediately

UBER apps ki feedback dewa jai Upfront system should be roll back to previous one Because longest route to be shown in this system

Corrupt Uber Driver Detected Driver Abul Hossain received my morning pick up request and denied to come to pick me up being close to my location At one point of our conversation he told me he can come if I pay him an extra amount of 100 tk I have denied to pay any extra amount and told him to cancel He has cancelled the trip I have submitted complaint against him to Uber His mobile number is 01712703947

Today I used the skip destination trick cause uber was showing a stupid route The driver turned the ac on after I told him to turn on Then there was no traffic jam the road was totally free And i was in hurry While driving he told me he will take gas and it ll take 2 min but it took around 5 to 6 min My question is is it wise to fuel up the car while the meter is on and the passenger is in a rush Also he was driving a old corolla car Rates him 2 star And i had too pay extra fare for his waiting

How does uber income from a drivwr partner I want to know in details All the transactions are happening customer to car owner through driver mostly in cash But what is uber s profit How uber takes his cut please share if you know

Took a ride with driver Rokibul His rating was 3 91 so I was bit concerned with that But later on I found him very much experienced and well behaved driver His car is bit ok type but the AC of the car is excellent So I directly asked him about his rating being below 4 he told me initially he was unable to use the app properly in addition to that the training he got from uber was not that helpful for him Now he can use the app perfectly as some rider gave him the instructions how to use the app properly He told me that if he cancel the trip on his own uber never impose financial penalty on them rather a person from uber office call them and ask why did he cancelled the trip very politely I m quite doubtful about his reply Fellow uber users is he correct about his reply



Positive Review It was a new axio AC was good and the driver was driving his own car He had a good taste of music as well D I wish I could rate him 6 p



What s this is this a promo code or what I didn t understand

One more bad experience of my bro with uber







I got an SMS that I will get TK 200 ride up to 7km up to 7th May So how should I execute it

Is there any one waiting on road Not getting uber Plz knock me

He was so dissatisfied due to bill payment by card



















Can anyone tell why is the charge here for 23 85 minutes

How the star feedback option actually work If the driver give 5 star or we give 5 to drive is there any benefit



I saw driver gave me 5 star on his mobile screen and so did i Honestly he deserves it and I rode with family Total fare was 325 tk I gave him 500 taka note and he gave me 150tk back I let him keep the change willlingly Now when I check back my rating I am seeing its NONE





The incident of this ride was on 11Th April My destination was from Atish Diponkor Road to Dhanmondi Road 1 When i call him he came to the pick point within 2 minutes But it took me 7 8 minutes to reach in the pick point I choose the pick point in the main road But he started the trip 5 minutes before i enter into the car And at the end he give me 1 star rating cause i didn t give him any tips isn t that enough if we behave gentle with the driver but when i saw he give me 1 star rating i also give him 1 star rating







Some Uber drivers have currently started the practice of giving low ratings if they don t receive tips Such drivers deserve to get 1 And to all Uber users PLEASE don t tip unless you are exceptionally impressed with your driver or if there are exceptional circumstances

I am new user Want to take my 1st ride but can not use any promo code Can any body suggest any solution

I had an excellent experience with Uber today I have already used Uber 50 times Today I requested for Uber and got within 3 min twice The car was like totally new and the driver s behaviour was quite good In fact while returning to my home I had the same experience The driver left me with a note bhalo thakben madam Attaching both the drivers screen shot I will continue with Uber if I get such service consistently By the way rated both with 5 star





Hello My family and I have a flight to catch tomorrow early morning from Hazrat Shahjalal Int Airport So I tried scheduling the uber today but it wouldn t let me it says pickup point is not available at this moment I m afraid if I order in the morning and it s late it would be a major problem Kindly advice what can be done 3



















On my last trip there is a difference between upfront and actually charged I raised the issue with uber and they sent me and an adjusted rout map instead of refunding the difference But before the trip whlie showed upfront fare the suggested route was different and driver followed the suggested route As we travel on same route regularly so noticed the same destination same route showes different distance and varies more then 1KM it may differ 100 400 m but 1 km absurd

Which areas are covered by Uber in BD From North to South and East to West









Normally UBER says you can earn up to 20 000 Taka per week by attaching your car with U BER So monthly income will be 20 000 x 4 80 000 taka This 80 000 Taka is your income not profit Yes according to UBER this will be your monthly income Now here comes the cost calculation In a month you can have maximum use 25days weekly 1 day off for driver So you have to earn per day 80 000 25 3 200 Taka 1 Uber commission 80 000 x 25 20 000 Taka 2 Driver s salary 15 000 Taka minimum 3 Driver s lunch 100 per day So lunch bill 100 x 30 3 000 Taka 4 For earning 3 200 Taka per day fuel cost will be minimum 1 000 Taka So monthly fuel cost 1 000 x 25 25 000 Taka So this is your total running cost per month is 20 000 15 000 3 000 25 00 63 000 Taka So you are thinking now you have a profit 80 000 63 000 16700 Taka NO this is WRONG if you use your car for fully business purpose in UBER you have to think that at the end of the year you have to pay almost 24 000 Taka for renew all papers It means per month cost 24 000 12 2 000 Taka If you want to earn 3 200 Taka per day you have to drive more or less 100km per day which means 100x 25 x 12 30 000 km per year or more Definitely it will cost you Minimum 4 wheels actually lifetime max 20 000km 4 x 5 000 20 000 Taka per year Means tyre cost 20 000 12 1 500 Taka per month Engine Oil Gear oil cost per month 2 000 Taka minimum for a fully functional car If you want to keep your AC fully running all through the year 30 000km running you must have to change Radiator Condenser AC gas refueling at least once in a year 5 000 5 000 2 000 12 000 Taka per year 12000 12 1 000 Taka per month definitely you have to calculate the engine gear box cost within 2 years almost 60 70 000 km run So Engine gear box replacement minimum 40 000 Taka in 2 year 20 000 Taka per year 1 500 Taka per month Dent Paint in minimum 2 years 30 000 Taka in 2 years 15 000 Taka per year 1250 Taka per month car wash servicing per month 750 Taka minimum at least a little bit repairing in a month 1000 Taka this is the not only minimum actually nothing So now you can calculate all the hidden cost papers tyres engine oil AC engine gear box Dent paint car wash repair 2000 1500 2000 1000 1500 1250 750 1000 11 000 Taka per month So calculate the profits 80 000 63 000 11 000 6000 Taka per month YESSSSS This 6 000 Taka per month is your Actual Profit Definitely there is huge cash flow but profit is not as like as cash flow only if your car is in UBER business calculation is like that Will give another post how you can make it more profitable who are the main profit maker

Yesterday morning i took an uber ride from mirpur to gulshan After reaching the destination the fare was not visible in driver s mobile it kept loading But as the fare was visible in my mobile in the your trips section in uber app i showed the fare to the driver cleared the payment When i asked for another uber ride yesterday night it showed like the below screenshot The same was also appeared today when i tried to ask for an uber ride The only way i can make another request is to accept that i will clear the due to the next ride which infact i already cleared Now how can i get rid of this problem Please suggest possible solutions



Uber support rocks Cause route wasn t the same as the suggested route

Shahidul vai one of the Best uber pilot in the Dhaka city Highly recommended Wanted to give him 10 star

I have Suzuki Baleno 1997 fresh car with tip top condition A C fully working Though i dont use that car Can i give this to UBER I heard they accept over 2000 model cars But they will look appearance Condition and all TIA

Isn t uber available in Ibrahimpur Please give this information



took two rides today first one from lakecity concord to popular diagnostic uttara second one from popular to lakecity concord both the drivers were good but second one was much more friendly his rating was 4 7 I also thought of giving him a 4 5 star but after completion of my ride when I checked my own rating it went straight down to 4 13 from 4 36 ps I checked my rating after my first ride I thought a driver having a rating of 4 7 obviously knows how to deal with the riders wont expect tips anyhow I could have rated him 1 star but I did not as he was good driver picked me up from the exact location even though he crossed the location but came back crossing heavy traffic wanted to turn on the ac but my brother was sick so we did not want the ac though he did not follow uber suggested route I did not have to pay extra money





Today i had a ride from banani to mirpur Some positive points 1 The driver took 5 of our friends in his car because our main car was stuck in banani for some circumstances 2 The driver came to my pickup point without even asking as many drivers ask where to come every time 3 His Allion car was as new as like bought from showroom yesterday 4 Was very friendly unlike other drivers 5 Most importantly i tried to give him 50tk as tips but he didn t take it Happy ubering 😊

I have an inquiry Yesterday I took an uber from Khilkhet to Rampura and my fare was Tk 665 I was overwhelmed by this So I checked and found something fishy In the cash memo it says my trip started on 8 36 pm But look at me caller id The driver called and confirmed at 8 37 pm Meaning that he started the trip immediately after getting the request Am I wrong Or did the driver really start the trip when I wasn t even in the car If he did what should I do



I complained to Uber because the driver used an unnecessary long poor route that s why I had to pay 65 tk extra than upfront fare So uber credited 65 tk on my account Bt there is no credit amount showing on my acc payment part Any suggestions What I can do







Nafis Hasan what to do about those riders who request for a ride then changes his pickup point here and there keeps the driver busy and cancel the request after wasting 1 hour this has happened quite few times











Driver s behaviour was very professional after my request he just called me for pickup location confirmation n didn t asked for my destination most of the uber driver ask for destination first Then he pick me up increased A c cooling n drove to my destination without any hassle It was a Toyota Corrolla neat n clean I gave him Tk 20 tip but he took it with shy smile😊I wish all of my Uber ride ended just like that Rated him 5 Happy Ubering 🚗



This is fact

Is Uber available after mid night









Today driver Nazir has received my call for drop off He called me and said he was just opposite to my office gate I was about to pass my office entrance he called me back and said if he can take CNG from the locality of my destination He asked my destination and started saying he can t go to my destination as there is no CNG station I could realize that he was making an excuse to avoid this trip Though he has already been listed as Bad Driver on Truecaller I thought people change so got ready to ride with him But I was proved totally wrong by Driver Nazir

P S This was my sister s trip Right after the trip started the driver suddenly turned off the A C and rolled down his window and acted like the passenger had no say about using the A C She being a girl couldn t argue with the driver so when she reached home I went down and asked the Uber driver why he turned of the A C and his reply was gas chilona takey toh ami bolei uthaisi je A C charte parbona whereas he didn t inform her about his car running low on gas or that he wouldn t be able to turn on the A C Driver s number 880 1937 428579



The Driver wanted to go offline with a last trip to Uttara And he was waiting to get a trip to Uttara from Bashundhara R A And after he found out my destination was Purana Paltan he did not want to cancel the trip He lied saying that he is On Trip now and he can not cancel a request while he is On Trip He even wanted me to speak to his passenger He said he will drop someone at Apollo after that he will cancel Whatever it was He did not cancel and he put me On hold En Route for almost Half and hour You can see the photos he was going away from my pick up location But who waited for him I came home with another Uber account P while he was still En Route to my pick up location Driver name Nurujjaman Driver phone 880 1932 658390















He picked up my request and didnt call me for a single time When i called he didnt pick up and now he is going to opposite direction I asked him to cancel the trip But he didnt And neither did i And he is not picking up phone Now i want to complain uber about it How to do that









Uber is profitable only for users not for vehicle owners Is there anybody to take this challenge



this driver did not perform the trip as i did not input the destination and behaveour rude





At last found a car from motijheel in the waterfull road Thanks to uber Btw driver tafiz come from jatrabari almost 6km far way from my pickup location and dont insist me to cancel Definitly will give him 5 after ride Happy Ubering









positive review emergency case মিরপুর ১০ এর galaxy হাসপাতাল থেকে মিরপুর ১ আসবো। উবারে গাড়ি কল করলাম। সাথে সাথে গাড়ি হাজির। কি বুঝে মনে হলো skip destination ট্রায় করি আজ। up front এ discount সহ ভাড়া এসে ছিল ৫৫ টাকা। আর এভাবে ভাড়া আসলো মাত্র ৫ টাকা। but the more interesting part of that trip was the politeness of the driver after the end of the trip he smiled at me and said u have to pay only 5 taka while I was getting out of the car as I was in hurry he said use uber again I was really surprised when I saw he rated me five note he drives his own car one of the best driver I meet

I m a new member of this group I take uber rides 4 5 times for longer distances face no hasstle at all After reading most of the post of this group I think we should not use uber for a small distance like Dhanmondi to Md pur because the fare for small distance may vary more problematic Just a thought of myself Thank you enjoy UBER

Used Uber during the scorching heat today The driver was really amicable and supportive Coupled with chilled AC fantastic car condition and the new Promo code the journey couldn t have been any better Rated him 5 star obviously Happy ubering





HUGE shout out to this driver Very well behaved he made sure the AC was working well and i was in contact with it Great ride

So I travelled from Bashundhara to Wari few days ago and my Bill came tk 560 and today I travelled from Gulshan 2 to Bashundhara 300ft and it costed tk335 Almost 3 4 of my last trip So my question is does Uber Charge more on short Distances travels 🤔



Today a bad uber driver rated me 1 star Before the ride my rating was 5 and after ride its 4 56 I called the driver and asked me how he rated me He said that he rated me 1 star since I did not give him tips My mistake I have rated him 5 star immediately after the ride How can I change the rating or rerate him





Added promo code into my uber account but its not showing while booking a ride which usually shows now Does anyone have any idea why the estimated fare is not being shown including the deducted promo amount

Guys any promo code Please













Used uber today Everything was fantastic except Uber s road suggestion A promo code was used by me before the trip From khilgaon goran tempostand to square hospital the fare was only 110 taka The driver was very good Rated him 5

K k paisw 40 off I think pray shobai e paiso 😇











App installed in my mom s handset During Uber account setting forgot to use invitation Promo code Now no promo code for the first ride What to do







How do I solve this problem Not able to request any ride

I m not a frequent uber user around 10 12 rides I guess my avg rating was 5 earlier but within my last two rides it has downgraded to 4 5 I dunno if that s because of using promo codes and not giving tips I had to cancel 3 4 trips as either cars were quite far drivers compelled me to do so So is there any way to detect what caused this down rating







Apply code NOBOBD50 and enjoy 50 off 5 rides till Sunday April 23 Max discount Tk 120 per trip Don t worry about your commute make it better Please let me know if you get the discount and enjoy your ride 😊😊😊









What to do when driver refused to come but he already accepted the request and when i call him he says cancel the request Why should i cancel and get cancelation fee Is there anyway to report these drivers Other two issues i need to inform uber BD 1 Giving request to a driver who is 50 min away is totally lame 2 New option of accepting request while dropping someone is worst option ever for Dhaka i waited for 45 minutes and then i had to cancel It s so irritating experience









What is the process to give a car to Uber

Jamil 880 1745 977 199 I took a trip to Chand Mia Housing from Banani 19 and I needed to drop a friend at Agargaon because it was very late at night Since Uber wasn t providing a route through Agargaon by default which it usually does but somehow it didn t yesterday I chose to skip destination After getting on the car Mr Jamil said Uber doesn t allow them to take trips without destination but somehow they gave that option on their own app huh and asked me to change it so I went to the app and updated the destination I was almost sure this was going to happen and no surprise he gave me 2 stars after the trip ended If by any chance the owner of this car is on this group also ask him to remove the বেলী ফুলের মালা from the rearview mirror coz it was rotten and gave a funky smell in the car



First time in my life I ve used taxi service in midnight 12 30am Tejgaon dhanmondi mohammadpur with Uber Happy with the safe journey

This group shows the increasing popularity of Uber in Dhaka Uberon

Do you anyone can advice me how to claim an objection or is there any call centre or customer support centre for UBER If anyone face any type of incident what we should do

Long back 6 months back I once installed uber app and chose my credit card and did not choose cash as mode of payment At the end of my very first trip the app tried deducted my bill from that very card but failed I then came to know that the bank did not accept it as uber is not a registered business company in BD as per govt rules As one bill still pending to be paid the app does allow to make another trip and now I am not able make any request over uber app Solution and way forward please anyone







How to use this promotion It s been added for so long but not applied yet







How do I know my rating as a rider



Normally I am not easy with upfront fare if driver or myself change the route it cost high then traffic jam when the driver did not see the destination point on their map most of the driver firstly hesitate so train them properly Why not withdraw probox car it is not a passenger car it is uncomfortable todays morning trip was





Worst UBER ride ever First of all the driver didn t call me even after being assigned by UBER to pick me up I waited for more than 10 minutes He was randomly roaming around the pickup point When I called him 2nd time he picked it up and said that his balance was 0 so he was unable to call me Fine I have no complaint about that When the car arrived i was shocked The car wasn t as i expected it was in poor condition and the AC wasn t working properly as well The worst part A police stopped the car and asked for the papers the driver asked me to tell the police that the owner of this car is my dad or else he might get into a big trouble I was shocked how can a driver from an international service can ask their passenger to lie to cover his illegal purposes His papers were not okay and police gave him 2 cases i guess I had to wait for more that 20 minutes as he left us in the car and was bargaining with the police Nothing to say Wors pickup ever Poor condition of car Papers were not okay Asking passenger to lie Leaving passenger in the car for more than 20 minutes and bargain with police Travelled more than 40 times with UBER Didn t expect this from them I think their quality is falling day by day Rated 1 star anyways









happiness is 5takay uber ride

How to add Upcoming trip to Uber Does it help availability of car

How do they adjust I mean how will it reflect in my account Anyone

i submitted a complain to uber i am posting here to see ur reaction i didnot find an appropriate place to complain thats why i m complaining here i did not care much about user rating but i heard low rated users may get suspended temporarily which concerns me i was rated 5 For last 4 rides i tipped and rated 5 stars each driver you can see that from my trips on that time i was using promo code so the fare was about 0 00 25 00 BDT and thats why tipped them to make them feel compensated And today i find out my overall rating is 3 17 i mean do i have to tip more to get my rating up or do i have to avoid using promo codes to handover cash to the drivers to make them satisfied and whose fault will it be if i get suspended awaiting answers did not get reply yet

Nice until

I think Uber should introduce auto call recording feature in their drivers cellphones at least this way they can be refrained from asking the destination and could be used as proof of his misbehavior to kick his butt out of service



How I will use my promo code in my current trip

Bad day for me as an uber rider Drivers cancelled rides couldn t manage a single ride really bad day







I think quality of Uber service has gone down drastically after introducing the new connect policy An uber On Trip is now connected to another client who is waiting at it s uber s destination It keeps that client waiting even for hours I dont think it s a policy that Uber has adopted worldwide

If we r thinking this only a group of uber passengers then it might goes wrong I think many uber drivers car owners r here N B I m a passenger only

How can I see my ratings

It s Time to share about an excellent review My mother was sick and discharged from hospital today morning I had requested uber and Mr Ershad was my driver with 5 star ratings He successfully came to the parking of the hospital without asking and then informed me that he was there I was on the 4th floor i told that i would need some time as my mother was sick and moved slower He told he would wait no matter After reaching ground floor he took all my bags and put them on the backside deck And started the trip by asking my permission For your information i would like to know you that im an old town boy 3 maximum drivers usually don t like to go there But he didn t utter anything about it He dropped us just in front of our gate though it was too traffic And help me to carry my bags to our garage inside Best thing was Before leaving he waved me 😂 All i want to say is this man served me more than a private driver That s the service what i wanted for my sick mother He truly deserves 5 stars 😀

Which is the best way for travalling ur day in Dhaka city

Uber should review its price policy for dhaka Present pricing is not fair enough to make a win win deal between drivers and partners Present pricing seems ok only those who invested Probox or too old car but for good and recent car its not justified If needs better car and driver s to satisfy customers need to review pricing

Can anyone please tell me the exact location of Banani Uber Office

Is this possible that the driver is receiving new pick up request while a passenger is on trip This happened twice with me today







As a Rider how can I check my Rider rating

Has Uber introduced a new rule for drivers to get an alert request for a new ride whilst the driver is already on a trip When I was coming back from office using Uber the driver got a Ride request That caused confusion Driver kept getting distracted as well Was it a system glitch or a new policy

Uber connected me with the following driver showing ETA 18 min but the driver asked me harshly to cancel the trip I was determined and didn t cancel the trip rather asked him to cancel if he didn t wan na take the trip He started arguing Later put me in On Trip and few seconds later finished the trip



The driver was really good but the seat was little uncomfortable







Now UBER is throwing new calls to drivers while they are already on trip Driver s are really confused



I travel from Uttara sector 10 to Dhanmondi regularly I usually ask Uber drivers to drive through the mirpur beribadh route instead of using Banani because of traffic Some drivers tell me they ve been asked by Uber NOT to use the beribadh route or use Gabtoli But some drivers have used beribadh without issues Its on the map What do i tell uber drivers who say they ve been instructed not to use beribadh





Need UBER offfice address at Banani Could anyone please provide me Interested to be a partner of UBER

Getting another trip request while completing a trip is a very bad situation for a Uber driver If he does not accept the request his acceptance rate will decrease which is a vital criteria for trip bonus eligibility and if he accepts the request the rider in the current trip will be irritaed and will give him poor rating



Todays new experience with Uber Driver can accept a second trip waiting when he is already on a trip Not a good idea at all today 1st driver accept my trip when he was going to banani A BIG LOL I hav to go from green road to sankor he was on beside Sonargaon hotel no response then I called him n knew dat strange matter n cancel Then I got my trip from green road to sankor that driver accept another passenger waiting at Sankor plaza I was lil bit uncomfortable n told him please first drop me at my office and then u pick that guy Its scary to b wid a stranger on d same car

Awareness post This driver refused to come and also refused to cancel Rude too He told me to wait the whole night lol I won t cancel this time let s see what happens next D

I was trying to add my debit card details but this was popping up everytime I tried Can anyone help me with this

My bad luck regarding rider rating continues Without any reason he rated me 1 after the trip The ride was as smooth as silk Even during pickup I went outside to a convenient location Later I called him to know why he did so and he lied that he rated me 5 Finally rated him 1 reported the issue to Uber

Used to think Uber was good bt I was proven wrong I was shown the cost from Green Road to Ring road 230 and was charged 385 What the hell was this

Driving with a good soulful driver the car conditions and interior is also cool though from outside it looks crap Only sadness is the driver is telling Sir উবারে সব লাভ তো মালিকের আমাদের কোনোই লাভ নাই

How to use promo code pls advice



This is very irritating 😠 that on ride driver receive another ride request please stop ✋ this new system cause this system should create miss understanding with drivers and riders

Treat from my uber driver 😇😇😇😇

My Uber driver has good taste in music Rock all the way

This driver asked my destination I refused to say He argued that he needs to know as they can not go outside Dhaka I told him it is inside Dhaka city corporation Then he told me to cancel I refused and told him to cancel He rudely responded that he did not call and I have to cancel I flat out refused and he disconnected the phone I have raised complaint to UBER immediately

Believe It or Not Uber tracks the cancellation rate for each driver week to week When it exceeds a certain percentage around 10 they send a warning to the driver If the cancellation rate continues to climb the driver risks deactivation Additionally Uber apparently enforces an escalating “ timeout ” for drivers who suddenly cancel more than one ride in a short period of time So drivers are not penalized for canceling individual rides but they are penalized sometimes severely by losing their ability to receive requests for uncorrected patterns of high cancellation rates











Hi everyone I see a lot of people here sharing info facts about Uber Bangladesh without any source or evidence That is still fine as long as you mention that it is your opinion result of discussion and not an official Uber policy For example last week someone mentioned that Uber drivers have created a group amongst themselves where they would give low ratings to passengers if we did not tip them There was absolutely no source or evidence for such a claim Uber is very very new to Bangladesh and as such very easy to spread rumours or misinformation My request to all of us is to be very sure when sharing info and best would be not post something controvertial without evidence or source That way we get rid of confusion and misinformation Thanks

How to check my own rating as passenger



My grandma and grandpa will go to square but unfortunately im not going They dont have phone and i will call uber Can they go without my phone

Post for Uber Riders Partners Drivers Few days back I conducted a survey in the group to identify for which reason a Rider will give 1 to driver and herr is the result This is a indication but still you partner driver can get a pulse of riders Top reasons of getting 1 1 if driver gives 1 to rider 2 if driver ask for tips 3 if driver s car is in bad condition 4 if driver ask for destination point f before arriving I see all the points are dependent on either driver or partner so If you driver deserves a good rating just avoid these things Happy Uber Ride

My Uber Diary In KL uber was not that much famous rather grab car was very economic and available i found lots of socially established person those were driving GRAB CAR just to create another income source and utilize their leisure time I was very curious to join uber as a partner as soon as i noticed the service in FB But the main barrier of becoming a Uber driver is a valid professional driving license It s like a night mare but i was very curious to join Well i started communicated with my contact here in BD and got the details of getting a professional license Believe me the process is so complex you may find easier to collect tiger s paw from Sundarban Then the journey started from BRTA 11 Apr then I visited BRTA office mirpur I got plenty of helpful people in other term broker to help me they made the process so complex purposefully that anyone will lose all the energy just after listening the process after several visit at BRTA I got a connection from my friend and lucky enough to visit AD s office directly He confirmed me that the system is very easy and helpful Then given me a list of document those are interested to get professional license check this list 1 NID copy 2 Application as I had non professional license 3 Two PP 4 Character certificate from village 5 Copy of my license and 200 tk submitted all the doc and money to be continued

Took uber from IDB to Jamunu Future park The driver just is just in his 1st week It took him around 18mins to reach my pick up point After starting he continuously switched off the A C In questioning the reason he replied the car is overheating He kept me wait under banani flyover for 14mins inside the car with all doors and windows closed The temperature outside was 34 degree centigrade He didn t even apologise after the trip 😢



After reading some posts in this group I sent an email to Uber support This was about an overcharged trip The fair was 360tk and I paid 560tk after arrival I didn t ask them for a refund just asked for an explanation why this happened Uber refunded me 213 71tk as credit Feeling good Thanks to all contributors of this group as long as we are strict on the law Uber Law and help each other I think we have a good chance to remove bad guys My suggestion Don t misbehave and Don t tolerate misbehave

😢😢😢

AWARENESS POST Avoid this driver if you can He brought a guy with him and said the guy is from Uber I didn t believe him and kicked the guy out

I think we need to think positive about UBER This groups feed is populated with such negative feeds and intensions that people are getting confused with such feeds Since the inception of UBER I am using this in regular intervals I have taken 64 rides so far – only 2 cases 3 Only I have options to complain to UBER and received positive feedback from them That was during their acquisition campaigns Mass acquisition may decrease the quality sometimes I also love to mention that my friends and families are also using this service and they are quite happy with this Most of my drives get 5 Star rating from me even I the EE90 ride because of their professional attitude and maintenance of the car Even some new comers I have to guide them about navigation system Think about this before UBER 1 Don ’ t we have to bargain with every single CNG Drivers 2 Don ’ t we need to wait long times on the road for suitable journey 3 Don ’ t we called Taxi services and they reached us with huge bills on the meter 4 Don ’ t we have to pay more for near distance travel 5 Do we have any complain process – who will hear complain and give feedback even sympathy 6 Do we know our rides ratings etc 7 Is there any other options for students who can earn 8 Even the owner of the cars are captivated by their drivers particularly Woman 9 Even rental car drivers – aren ’ t they are getting continuous trips to feed their families and earn extras No – not at all Think UBER as blessings for urban commuters Forgiveness is divine – let ’ s remove the parasites from the system Embrace UBER… Happy Riding… Be Positive









Today i took uber for psc convention hall On the way at kalshi trip was cancelled n driver showed me 200 tk bill But in my phone trip was on Again on his phone trip was on N he took me psc by all narrow roads due to traffic at purobi However after that at psc he closed the trip but it still showed 200 tk So he asked me to adjust Finally i ended up with 350 tk Though i had promotion

I have seen in my newsfeed some of my friends telling that uber is very expensive I believe they are used to hang in local buses comparing to other car services in Dhaka i think Uber is reasonable I have taken couple of rides I had good experience with it Wishing everyone a happy ride

I badly need an uber ride



Had bad experience for the first time Take a ride from my home to Anwer Khan Modern Medical Hospital When we had a conversation via phone he refused to come to my pickup point until we are already there For reason he said that police will create problem if he stay there for long time We take it easy and go to the pickup point Now next situation arrived when I ask to follow him the route that uber suggested to follow He started an argument with me that he should not follow the route because uber suggests bullshit routes He said that he will visit uber office asap to teach them how to set map Finally after some arguments he started to follow the route Finally when we arrived there again I had an argument with him about the payment After that I found that he gave me 1 star and my rating goes down from 4 68 to 4 52 And I also gave him 1 star for his bad and unprofessional behavior Now can someone show me the way how can I submit complain against him for such case Thank you



I took a ride and reached my destination at 8 20 The driver was new and he said he is unable to end the trip He tried the way he was taught but failed to end the trip Since I was in a hurry and already wasted 10 minutes on this issue I gave him the approximate fare that was shown on the app in the beginning and told him to end the trip as soon as he can Now it s 8 50 and the guy still hasn t ended the trip I called him but he kept rejecting my call I tried to cancel the trip from my app but it s not working What should I do Thanks in advance P S screenshots are on the comment section Thanks





How can I use this promotion Thanks in advance

Today I was returning from Square Hospital I connected with a driver After called him he asked me to go to opposite side of the Square Hospital After went over there I called the driver again and then he refused to go to my destination and told me to cancel the trip I disagreed with him and told him to cancel by his own In my next search I was connected with him again automatically And he remained silent with a bad intention so that I had to cancel my pick up I cancelled the 2nd trip after falling in trap of the driver The driver was so unprofessional The driver number is 01728750342 This is second time I got refused by the driver after accepting the trip and in both case I was returning back from Hospital I am a frequent user of Uber But this kind of incident make us uncomfortable with Uber

How is he in uber with this rating o





In last 3 months I took 29 Uber rides and out of them only one asked me for tips So far I also had to cancel 17 requests due to long distance but most of the drivers had requested it politely From my experience I believe the number of bad drivers is very low What we can do is make a list of bad drivers Anyone faces a bad experience can put a screen shot of the driver with detailed explanation and in this group we can compile that Also we will boycott trips with those drivers That way we can avoid generalized complaints against drivers Any thoughts

Is it possible the change the route shown in Uber App while requesting for a drive If so will the fare be changed varied accordingly Please reply soon Thanks

Post for Uber Riders I use uber both as rider and driver Few people are misusing this platform by misinterpreting facts and provocating one riders againt another drivers They are just going with the flow by posting spicy posts without knowing any real system flow I appreciate their effort cause they are spending a lot of time and effort to entertain others I request you to take those as a FUN DONT TAKE THOSE SERIUOSLY Uber has brought a great change for both riders and drivers partners By this Service Uber few people organization are facing business challenges like CNG taxi and ToMA taxi cab rent a car business etc I can relate their uber related frustration with such business loss We must share our experince to discuss for the betterment but we must not set a predetermined mindset for drivers or service If these service becomes a loss we riders partner will be the main victim and CNG taxi and Toma taxi cab will be gainer Lets make Uber a win win solution for all Happy Uber Ride



Sharing an experience of last night with regards to rating My rating dropped from 4 64 to 4 54 I have taken 25 rides so it indicated a rating of 2 or 3 from the driver so I called him and asked why he gave a poor rating I also tipped him few bucks as it was around 1am His answer Sir you are the best customer I received since driving for two weeks you even tipped me which is very appreciable hence I gave you the best rating I usually give 2 or 1 depending on good or bad When I explained him how the rating works and taught him how he should rate the customers he said sorry and wanted to change my rating The damage has already been done to his past users who got 2 star at maximum even being good I did complain to uber about this and asked them to teach the drivers thoroughly PS Next time you get a poor rating I would recommend calling the driver and asking him the reason for that If the reason is such illiteracy about the system then it will help all the users if you can address that



If anyone comes to get the review of Uber here prior to actually getting the service this group would scare the hell out of the passenger On the contrary my experience so far considering around 50 trips I have taken with Uber is not that bad In fact all of them are great The cars were cool most of the drivers were decent the fare was fair the availability was good In one word Uber has raised the standard of transportation service in Bangladesh However I have faced something yesterday that really concerns me I think most of the cars are privately owned and doesn ’ t have a Rent a Car license I think I am not sure though still in Bangladesh if any car is used in carrying the passenger it needs to get a different kind of permission from BRTA I believe Uber still has not been able to come to any sort of agreement with BRTA that permits them to operate legally under this framework So yesterday when I took a ride the car was stopped by a Traffic Police and we were asked whether we own the car or it is on rent I had no idea what to do in that situation and told the truth So the police called in the driver while we were waiting in the car The driver came back and said he had to settle Tk 100 00 as the bribe So is there anyone who can suggest what to do in these situations Has Uber got their legal permit to operate in Bangladesh











Your opinion may help Uber to improve your Uber experience Question is I m giving 1 to my uber driver cause he

Not related with this grp But find this grp very useful Pls help if you know details where can i find BRTA fees informations for newly purchased car registration fee Fitness tax payment information for both1331cc 1500cc TIA





After showing upfront fare it doesn t work uber charged more than that Complained and get returned

Bad Uber driver alert This guy didn t even call by himself I had to call him first He was quite close yet didn t understand my location nor did he understood from the map After the call he started the trip almost 5 minutes before he reached my pickup point It was a shitty Corolla 110 way below the usual 110 Corollas I ve rode so far in Uber Lastly upon reaching my destination point he said he had no change and subtly tried to give me the whole 100 bucks even though my bill showed 60tk He was also mumbling something about different fare being showed on his phone and mine and how he got less than what it showed on the passanger s phone Most disturbingly when I got the change from the nearby shop he gave me shitty ratings My overall ratings went down from 4 85 to 4 77 Pretty much the worst experience I had in almost 40 50 rides I had with Uber so far

This stupid driver accepted the trip refused to come start the trip without coming Reported to Uber Let s see what action Uber take













question to the people who use credit card payment option does uber charge in BDT or USD

JFP theke Uber daklam Sir ashben na bole dilen bollen cancel koren ami bollam korbo na as he was right outside Jamuna Future Park on the main road I asked him to come inside near the Pick up gate that was my fault then after 15 min he called and said he is coming he came within 3 4 minutes But what happened after that was truly amazing He was saying all this ami Purbo dike asi ami Poshchim dike asi ami main gate e asi ami Bashundhara Gate e asi he made me walk all around Jamuna Suddenly I realized he already had put me ON TRIP And after few minutes he cancelled the trip and gave me a 1 star rating But Finally got another from a different account and got someone to pick me up from Khilkhet Good Driver Good Car Great Service Saw two sides of UBER on the same day

After rode with him my rating become 4 42 from 4 62 only for not giving him tips i think my fare was 0 😊



one of the worst driver 😡 He denied my request to come my place to pick up though the time to reach showed that 11 minutes Therefore he forced me to cancel the request also threated me his number 8801747573032 Give up his ride



Problem solved Don t get panicked if uber charges you more They will definitely give it back to you Till now they replied my each and every report with satisfactory answers GoodCustomerService Uber







I am facing a problem since my last uber ride There is showing an oustanding payment for BDT 184 60 on my uber home screen In my last ride after arrival at my destination point the driver press end the trip button on his mobile screen but it took long time to calculate the fare may networkproblem He again press the button for several times since the calculated fare could not come into his screen as well as into my screen After 5th 6th time asked me to give BDT 180 00 and i paid the money leave the car But still now there is a notification message for an outstanding payment I have send a message mentioning the problem to uber help What can i do Will i be charge for the oustanding amount In my next uber ride

I would like to share one of my experiences regarding bad attitude of an Uber driver This happened a couple of month ago I request a ride and wait of the driver s call mainly because it s the driver who always calls He doesn t call He does nothing Just sits there accepting my request After sever minutes I call him back and ask him why he wouldn t call me He goes কল্ তো আপনি দিবেন আমি কেন I ask him if Uber instructed him to do so He now says Uber বলেব কেন। আমি বললাম এটা You get the idea So I say nothing more and proceed to cancel the ride I file a complaint to Uber Uber calls me from India next day and said they were sorry for this and that the driver partner had been notified and warned So if someone misbehaves as others have suggested it s best not to misbehave back and just stay calm and later complain to Uber Let Uber handle things their way







Somebody are talking that uber driver also rate their clients If anybody know How can uber users check their rating pls share







I paid the uber driver 160TK cash but why app and Mail shows cash 0 00





I paid the uber driver 180TK cash but my app showing its as outstanding payment can anybody explain me note that that was my first ride using Uber

Any offers available right now Looking for some codes 😁

Worst thing of UBER They don t have any customer service number come on everyone doesn t know technology that much and most of them doesn t know how to make complain They are well known company but don t know why they do have very poor strategy in terms of Bangladesh Market Does anyone belongs here as Uber staff Or it s just being created by someone



Awareness Post The Car s brake failed and was about to hit Mirraclly the driver managed to stop by using handbrake Even after identifying the problem Driver offered us to drive to our destination by using manual handbrake How irresponsible 😬😠 The Car was very poor in quality and upon questioning Driver admitted that the brake system needs mechanical servicing😨 He came from Uttara and upon dropping us in Banani he will go to the Garage There should be some minimum quality of cars used in Uber



pickup er agei journey start korey disey what to do



any idea

I m not sure but is this a good rating or not Is there any features or actions related with rating

From a drivers standpoint a low rating translates into a risky passenger that is often rude or demanding doesn t tip sexually harasses drivers has vomited in a car puts feet up on seats is loud and abrasive insists on navigating etc Consequently a low rated passenger is less likely to be picked up or may experience longer wait times





As a user how do I know my rating

Well I don t know if it will be novice to ask but still I wan na know exactly what are the issues problems if the uber riders like me are underated by the drivers







Got 100 ride for 3 ride after that no new promo code why how I can get promo code



Hello Good peoples Regarding Uber user rating I have something in mind to share As currently some driving abusing Uber TOS Even some of claims like that drivers are giving good rating for those who re giving them tips So I think we can do like bellow to stop this bullshit and can do driver animation Step 1 While on driving if the driver car is good enough to give 5 star then ask him as example Right now my rating is 4 5 after finishing your ride give me 5 star within an hour in return I will give you the same which will increase your rating to get more trips If you failed to give me rating within an hour I will give you 1 start Step 2 After this driver should give you rating instantly or wait for an hour See if your rating increase then give him as you promised and in case of reduce give him 1 star On an another note rating system is harmful for the Uber partner not user so we should animate them not animated by them Also you have to check your rating before ride

Didn t receive any promo code from 26 march What could be the problem Is there any rating issue











I need the customer care services number I ride several times and there are several massage on my mobile for discount but the driver didn t allow me the discount I need to know why discount was not allowed to me I spect an early reply

I gave him 5 star but he gave me poor rating The only reason I can guess is card payment





What is the customer care number of Uber

He requested me to cancel but due to upfront fare system my taka was deducted in advance from card So I had to tell him if you don t go you have to cancel

Today around 9 30 pm I requested a uber from my friends father account I was in front of east west university at aftabnagar with my friend and her father This car was in banasree It was raining so I requested him to come at my pickup location and by his talk he was not happy with it and he started giving excuses of heavy traffic and so on Then I said ok pick us from rampura bridge again he refused to come and he told me to cancel it when I refused to cancel it because as we all know if the driver is unable to go he will cancel it after that he started to shout at me no matter what I have to cancel it and then he cut the phone Few seconds later I saw he started the trip with out picking us I was really shocked One minute late he called back and asked with a very rude voice why I am not cancelling it I asked him why he started the trip with out us he reply was like this problem arise because of me Cancel it or not it s not his concern and he end the conversation by using some slang word It was really very embarrassing insulting for us I have already reported it So everyone we all should report this kind of problems Otherwise this problems will increase day by day and it will affect other users Peace ✌️













Recently it has been observed that though uber drivers are good but they are not satisfied with the payment They think the current fair is not enough for the uber partners to continue this service On the other hand uber riders thinks that uber fair is high

Since last week I havn t received any Promo code from Uber Without that uber seems expensive Can t use it as an everyday ride







It was a wise decision to skip destination today D Suggested fare with destination was Tk 430 but I managed to save Tk 100 by skipping destination D



Used one of two free rides up to 200tk When the driver reached my dropping destination and saw 0 00tk his face was a thing to look at 😂😂 though he rated me with 4 stars and I complemented him with 5 stars in return

On 4th of April i took a ride from Bashundhara to Uttara I usually pay around BDT180 However i had to pay BDT430 because that s what appeared on the driver s phone This was way higher than the uber upfront fare that they showed to me before i called for a ride So i looked at the receipt it showed I traveled for more than 20Km which was insane So all i did was reported it to uber and they have returned my money within 48 hours So to all of you if u ever face such problems do not get apprehensive about it just report to uber

Dear all Anyone could you please give me the uber help line no Thanks

Used Uber last night After I requested a trip I got a call from the driver and found out he was just in front of the street that I live in To spare him from inconvenience I told him to stay where he was and I travelled the short distance by foot The car was okay ish it was an old model Toyota Corolla it kept making noises every time it reached a high speed The driver seemed to be in a lot of hurry and although it wasn t a reckless driving but the journey was not very comfortable Nevertheless I stayed mum and the journey ended peacefully The most interesting thing is before I made this trip my average rating was 5 0 stars but after yesterday it s 3 8 Looks like I got this poor rating for not offering him any tips Yet no matter what happens how poor my rating gets I will not give any tips No way

Should I complain if uber driver wore a lungi and kept on abusing a person over the phone throughout the journey in very bad language

Uber a 5 rider rating pawar tricks While riding in uber discuss with travel partner about the uber rating system and mention that you check your rating before an uber ride and you are able to know the rating driver gave you after the ride If driver gv you poor rating you would happily return the favor and voila you got a 5 rating from your driver I have accidentaly started this once and see the positive result hope this help you too happy ubering p

Users wrote about two topics the most discount code and rating Dear discount meant to be promotional happens sometimes in a year u can t live a discounted life whole year second is rating I never saw in west any users care about rating at all as every one has better things to do in life than worried about Uber rating I felt like this is one of those I am a GPA 5 situation this is no personal attack to any individuals we should focus how to make our life a 5 rating and stop worrying about Uber rating

No promo code no Ubering Without discounts Uber is a bit expensive for most of the users Some will say if 3 4 people are there then it s convenient So can we make a platform where we can communicate each other and share the fare Suppose I request Uber to fetch me after that I will search for other Uber riders then fetch them If my destination is nearly matched with their destination then the other riders will find me in map What do you say

This driver expecting rating without pick me up What to do

Hi good evening everyone can anyone tell me how to fix this problem Thanks in advance



Did anyone notice this before that any valid invalid integer number can be given as input to see the user s rating you can check with a different phone number or a random number which is not a phone number at all and rating will be the same but it s not supposed to work with the invalid number and a warning message needs to pop up Either UBER doesn t validate the number at all or it s a bug which needs to solve

Are you are interested to drive your own self driven car in Uber Serivce

Uber driver refuse to pickup from Baridhara R A coz he couldn t enter to diplomatic zone told to cancel the request from my end Is that true



Post for Uber Riders Uber uses a complex matrix to offer e ride to driver That includes drivers rating drivers acceptance rate current status etc Drivers can see the point of request but they get only 15 Sec to respond In most of the cases drivers accept request without seeing or understanding pickup point Once the request is not accepted by the first driver it travels to next driver as per the matrix score So u can t expect a closer driver for ur next ride though you are seeing a bunch of fleets near to you Happy Uber Ride

Is there anyone tried split fare option



Since the day I enrolled with uber I ve been enjoying discounts all most every week So far experience is good Hope they keep their service up to the mark always

Re Post for Uber Riders Pls show proper respect to Uber drivers Sometimes riders become impatient and rude This impact on driving one bad experience trigger another bad experience Just few tips from my experience 1 Reply to his Salam if he gives u salam or any greetings u prefer 2 Don t address him as Tumi unless u are really old 3 Help him with direction as the map is not very helpful while driving 4 Help him to understand it discomfort with AC Any smell inside car Music driving or any thing 5 Try to give him exact fare cause sometimes change becomes a challenge 6 Pls Pls Pls dont smoke inside car cause this brings discomfort for next rider and eventually the driver gets lower rating 7 Don t take any food inside the car if you are not confident to keep inside clean to be continued Lets make this service a win win for all Happy Uber Ride

Who is the lucky highroller















I see a lots of complain here about your Uber ride old cars no air condition dishonesty from driver not enough service for clients this is to do with Uber Mismanagement they are looking for qty over quality and allowed any sort of old cars being used without some basic check for the service Here s how it should be No cars should be allowed for Uber service if registration is over 7 8 years Cars should be checked thoroughly before Uber registration Car should be fully cleaned and good smell Driver should be well dressed and mannered Driver should call rider for confirmation and location asap once a job is accepted Driver should call the rider once arrived in the pick up point Driver should open the door and help rider with luggage if possible Driver should consult the route with riders before start pls mind dhaka map is still not updated enough and there is no live traffic system Driver than should ask rider for AC on and any choice of music Driver than should mention about the free charger for mobile and paid drinking water and snacks availability in the car if needed Driver should also mention it s a non smoking car Once ride is complete driver should complete the job on the screen in front of riders Driver should never ask for tips unless rider is willing to provide Driver should show respect and thanks rider for their business and if riders want they can exchange number for future booking Now this is the Uber service I m willing to provide for my clients and challenging the existing poor scenario If you think this is how service should be than please raise your concern with Uber and start booking with me 😃😃😃 i want to break this chain of poor management and service in Bangladesh and want to give the best to my clients what they actually deserve we also take private booking

When riders cancel frequently drivers feel burned and are less likely to accept pickups This leads to drivers rejecting longer pickups or calling clients to make sure that they want a pickup Uber is efficient and elegant transportation Unnecessary phone calls and rejected pickups are not Uber



















Some of the new users are not being able to add Cash as a payment option and local credit cards are not accepted as well Is there any workaround to this problem

what is happening now

Uber app for windows phone is so irritating as well as frustrating Can not find location exactly most of the time Can not see promotion validity Uber should value windows 10 os users

How can i know my rating

I had a good reliability on Uber at Bangladesh but i guess at the end of the day its Bangladesh we re living in where nothing can be relied on Fare showed 395 taka but the driver showed on his app its 623 taka it was late night so couldn t argue much so complained to Uber lets see how they deal their customer satisfaction





Bad things happen on the fly Just a bit ago I was discussing about overall system and drivers just now got a bitter experience I called a Uber from Panthapath where I reached with a Uber as I stated in earlier post for my relatives and the destination was to Mirpur 14 The route was usual through kazipara mirpur 10 and so on The system showed fare 290 but after reaching the destination it was 440 taka Middle of the ride driver asked if they could arrange the cantonment bypass and my relatives denied So no route changed happened But why then the extra fare Though I complained about this but to me the system itself is doing wrong calculation willingly and the persons who can complain they are just refunded Otherwise they keep everything to them



Can anyone give me a promo code

















promo code for regular user please



UBER Driver who are using X Corolla they are tagged as Corolla Driver who are using dinosaur era Corolla they are also tagged as Corolla Don t you think we should complain as it s not fair



Beware of this fraud driver Jayanal who put me on trip before my arrival and as per suggestions from this group i didnt argue with the driver and simply asked the driver that i will not take the ride with him and as i didnt take part in arguing with him he started arguing with my gatekeeper and morover rather cancelling the trip he was roam around and later call me for trip fare whether i didnt even step a foot in his car I had cancel 3 time as the driver rating was 3 2 but unfortunately everytime i was getting the same driver as he was standing just beside my home More surprisingly i received a call couple of minutes ago from this number 8801982888444 claiming driver complained against me that I didnt pay his fare For bitter experience i received apology call from India but can anyone tell if this number is valid uber hotline or not and what can i do in such cases as riders couldnt cancel the trip after drivers put us on trip TIA

Post for Uber Rider Next few days upfront fare would be beneficial for uber rider DMP has already shared potential blockade plan due to VVIP movement and that will surely cause unexpected delay Try to stick with fix billing by taking drop at mentioned place other wise u might get charged at actual and that could be higher than usual expectation Happy Uber Ride 😉



The thing is Uber is still confused on picking the best routes or picking long routes willingly Not every time every road is accessible which is not updated on Uber system Let me explain with couple of cases with me Just a while ago I took Uber from Dhanmondi to Panthapath Now the regular routes were for some reason all blocked some VIPs coming towards Dhanmondi 32 and so we had to pick different routes waiting in jam over 2 hours It happened due to going as per the map I could easily go through kalabagan and reach my destination easily and happily Both parties here are in loss The driver didn t get money for those 2 hours and from my end these 2 hours were vital for me as I was visiting to a doctor Moreover the map directions were showing different in drivers app and in my app So we were confused which one to pick and if this is the case that may happen without seeing the driver s phone I m not sure I m tracking him well regarding he was taking the map route or not So confusion here Couple of days back again riding from Dhanmondi to Gulshan the initial fare showed me 370 but when I reached it charged 420 taka Now I saw the routes being changed 3 times and it s not driver s fault He had to do it as traffic police was not allowing him on that particular route on that very time and for one instance he used alternative to deny the jam ahead So how to track these things and I don t see reasons to blame the driver rather than the Uber system itself The upfront system isn t feasible yet in our country situation as the roads and traffics are not known prior to a ride The 1st world countries have their own navigation maps and they know beforehand where an accident happened and what alternative route can be Besides we have so many obstacles like road blocks for VIPS under construction may be narrow paths etc which are not compliant with the Uber system algorithm Regarding the drivers only 1 in so many rides I found a driver to be arrogant otherwise all are fine But found couple of times others on phone when they asked to cancel or marked the TRIP ON though I didn t take the ride But the riding experiences are so far good It s the system which needs to match our environment and drivers need to learn a more They are often missing GPS navigation

I had a good reliability on Uber at Bangladesh but i guess at the end of the day its Bangladesh we re living in where nothing can be relied on Fare showed 395 taka but the driver showed on his app its 623 taka it was late night so couldn t argue much so complained to Uber lets see how they deal their customer satisfaction

What s the point to travel such huge way whether I can go and taking left turn Uber is trying to make people fool now days and wants to increase the bill such way It s too early for Uber or else you will kick out from market









Is it logical



Recently a new option was given to driver to accept request while driving To avoid any bitter experience if you find your Uber car is going away from you after accepting your request call and get the status This is a new feature given to drivers to save waiting time but might not be very comfortable for riders Happy Uber Ride 😉

Uber may recruit people to give drivers behaviorism mannerism lessons to boost the brand value and attract more customers and also become a pioneer in this country in initiating a drive to teach mannerism By the way I offer myself as a teacher for the case trying to take advantage



What type of messages is this Please kindly let me know all UBER Specilist 😜😬



















In case your promo code doesnt work Chill Use this option to report You will get refund

Uber should introduce TRIP START option by mutually agreed both party Uber driver may start trip earlier but passenger also need to accept his start trip offer by Apps only then real trip ll commence We strongly believe Uber may help to change BD transportation system with good co operation with Govt

Can I make a request in Uber on behalf of someone

Can anyone tell me how can I avail this Please note my location is set to Bangladesh

how to be a uber driver anyone help pls

5 uber trips today Not a single slightest complaint Very happy



Today I had a worst experience I was searching for a car from Malibagh to Bashundhara R A I called a driver he asked for extra money more than the expected fare showed in the apps otherwise he cant go Then he cancelled the trip by himself After that I called another driver he told that he is coming After few minutes he called me also asked for extra money I answered that this is unfare he replied gele jaben na gele nai r jodi nai jan tahole trip cancel koren Then I replied ami cancel korbo na He told that na korle mara khan Their behaviour was totally unprofessional they behaved with me so rudely their behaviour was not like a human

Is there any such rule that the driver shoulld start the trip as soon as within 5 minutes of reaching the pick up point This driver claimed so He started the trip as soon as he reached the pickup point as per my mobile record but claimed the ruule is 5 minutes I was in a hurry so didnt cancell

it was a first journey with Uber really its good enough 😊



For those who gets confused destination in Uber the rule is Drivers only know the following before accepting the request First name Location to be picked up How far is the location Rider rating Surge if any Drivers don t know where the destination will be because Uber does not let them pick and choose between short or long trips Once the driver arrives to pick up location and swipes Arrived then the passenger destination shows Also as far as I know if you call the driver thru the app your personal number does not show somehow Drivers usually have around 15 seconds I think to tap the screen and accept the trip or else it goes to another driver If ever there is a mistake in the above infos feel free to correct it









What is upfront means Can anyone clear it to me please









I added payment method credit card while I signed up at the earlier age of Uber BD Apps was showing charged from credit card on my first ride but later on payment was stuck as my credit card USD portion was not activated Now I am facing this problem of changing payment method as you can see in the screenshot Any idea how to solve this already sent an email to them but yet to rcv an answer since Dec 16

from the very beginning I am a regular user of uber in dhaka Even before uber comes in Dhaka When I went to Kalkata I used uber service But today I faced an unpleasant situation My home is Mohammadi Housing Limited but when I search for destination that is not shown in my map Instead the nearest location Shia Majshid is shown which is 5 minutes away from my home as Its not possible to show the exact destination because exact home road number was not found while selecting where to go I always show the nearest available location But the driver refused to go to my road press the complete the trip option in his mobile app He was also very dissatisfied angry because of my payment of bill through credit card instead of cash What he said me is I shouldn t pay bill by cards He angrily said that it ’ s his personal car for me he have to go to somewhere else to collect payment But as uber authority has the system to pay bill through credit card he is driving the car under uber by agreeing uber s terms conditions isn t it unacceptable if he becomes angry with me due to my payment of bill by cards



it was my very first uber ride the driver Fazlur was really polite and has good driving skill the car x corolla 1300cc manual gear P was also neat and clean properly seriously i enjoyed my first ride though i didn t get my discount as first ride anyways first e ekta ride call korlam but oita onek dure chilo and rating 3 7 chilo bole cancel kore disi then abar call kore enake kachei pelam special thanks to Muntasir Mahmud vai for appreciate me

I m a new uber user my friend use uber and always enjoy discount thru msg but I didn t receive any discount offer though already used 5 ride Please advise why such discrimination what is the standard procedure to enjoy discount







Driver demand for tips that is not acceptable

Basically what happens when a passenger s rating gets low Uber users will find it more difficult to get a ride This effect can accelerate rapidly because when the closest driver doesn t accept a request the next driver is further away and so even LESS likely to accept the request and there is a snowball effect These passengers will find themselves unable to get rides when they most need one

Well behaved trained Driver Came to my pickup point which is little tricky without any instruction



Why should we pay same fare for allion EE90 100 good Air cooling system can t be the criteria of standard Now I got ta corolla 100 with damaged tire seems I m ubering on water taxi added with aroma of driver s paan jarda

Is UBER is available for the AIRPORT trip I mean can UBER get into the AIRPORT to drop a passenger for a flight Pls help me to know it TIA

Yeah almost covers everything Attention to the hidden uber employees



One of the major problems of Uber drivers does not want to go to short distances The drivers feel it is not feasible to go to short distances Rather than imposing it on drivers I think if they re was dynamic fare system like if the ride is less than 3 km per km will be 35 tk per km rather than the present 21 taka per km things would have been better Riders who wants to go to short distance can request if they accept this fare and drivers will also be happy Do you think the drivers will be more interested to take all trips As a rider does this sound logical to you



Can anyone please explain this calculation



Does Uber Bangladesh has any helpline number for its riders

Slowly approaching 100 rides 90 positive experience so far loving it Wanted to share a few tips with everyone 1 If Uber can not locate you and if there is a common landmark within walking distance walk over there and call Uber For example Navana Tower is 2 mins away from my house I usually call Uber from there Saves a lot of time and hassle 2 If you see any bad practise by driver immediately report it to Uber rate the driver poor tell the driver exactly why he is wrong Pls pls pls don t ignore it or try to be polite Uber has excellent feedback system and they really do take action Your feedback will help fellow passengers drivers by rewarding good practises punishing poor performers 3 Try to hook up your credit card with payment Again it is very much efficient and stops driver from bad practise 4 Make sure the Uber driver starts the journey as soon as you get in the car and not give them an opportunity to ask you for extra money later 5 Lastly be nice to the drivers Almost all of them are trying hard and this is new for them too A smile and a thanks go a long way Happy Ubering Pls also share your tips

About more than 5 thousand rides occur everyday with Uber Bangladesh Among them only 20 25 complain I think most of the other rides r Ok Then complain is less then 1 only So don t b disappointed I think service will b more professional when they will get legal permission and employee will come out from hidden role

Driving from Goran to Panthapath If anyone needs a ride let me know





Typical common reply from Uber A C was not working at all and left wiper was also damaged while it was raining heavily on Saturday evening I could not even open window due to heavy rain I found these faults only after starting the ride and it was raining so I could not cancel the ride or change car as I was in a rush to reach the destination Even driver had real difficulties to drive the car with a broken wiper and without a c How could uber allowed these faulty cars We may not get good and well mannered driver in all the rides but at least we deserve good car for safe and comfortable ride which we are paying for And I don t give a damn F to their typical sorry reply Really annoyed

The article on Dhaka Tribune may not represent the majority of the customers and we are more or less happy when the nearest competitors are CNG and Trust Toma cab But I expect more from Uber they know better than me or you How do they expect the same approach in India will work in Dhaka Even if there are very low volume of complains there are actually a few issues and Uber plans to solve them by operating majorly from India All of the suffered passengers would have felt much better if someone called them up and just apologized for what happened Do you really think Uber is trying to listen to what we are saying I am concerned about their concentration in this market and being the only player they are in the liberty to act as they wish Within 2 months of launch they have increased fare and in 4 months they have introduced fixed fare I agree we may have flaws but it is Uber they should have known the customers and how to handle them They should have people on ground to understand the market They may be intentionally avoiding this until they get official approval from Government All over Uber is going though a hard time and it is effecting them My point of view is very simple if McDonalds opens up in Dhaka and I step in I expect the same service and quality of ingredients they maintain all through if the staff can t perform because the clients does not order properly who is it to blame





Finally I got another good driver from my last hour uber ride He was very polite and good person He took my request after 12 am it was around 12 30 am Uber authority should look after carefully customer service otherwise who s people actually doing good for their passengers and service their contribution being useless for some stupid mannerless drivers What I faced my last trip

Has anyone ever travelled in uber at 7AM near Bashundhara Need to know if they are available at that time of the day

I joined this group to know some good tips on Uber service or how to use It properly and not to miss any good information SINCE i use Uber a lot Im also a working woman and have not faced any problem so far Al hamdulliah But ever since I joined here I only see complaining news from the user rather getting info on promotion fares etc which makes me real surprise Hope these are real ones rather political matter I will support Uber service in BD because I know the hassle of getting CNG therefore I will unfollow this group unless I really find some good information Or I experience some bad issues of my own



Can anyone please give me a promo code TIA

Feeling very happy Its a very happy ride by Uber Special thanks to Uber for their free ride based complain against a driver This driver was so cool n experienced Nice conversation with him Uber made my meeting successful









If I don t follow Uber s recommended route but rather take another alternative route which is faster than it Bypassing from Dhaka Cantonment then will my upfront fare still increase after the trip



So far all my rides went good and I really appreciate uber service as sometimes safety and convenience matter most happy ubering

I want advice will it be a good idea to use Pajero or Jeep type car for UBER I want UBER users comments





I have noticed something here in the group And i want to clear it If you have a bad experience with Uber dont act rude towards the Uber staff while asking for help They are there to help you if you are in trouble why behave rude with them They have no control over Uber driver s mood Before acting so rude towards them do your personal research to know the whole UBER system

What would be tomorrow s discount code





So i was coming back from Bashundhara to uttara The 1st driver politely asked me if i would wait in his car for refuelling Then as i said no he himself cancelled the trip and didn t ask me to do so which i appreciated a lot Then i got on this driver s car He was also good however I couldn t figure out the reasons behind his such dismal rating Anyway i had to pay only TK 170 Happy Ubering

So far I rode UBER 18 times and mostly had good drivers and cars Only once the AC was not working But I have never experienced any driver saying that he can not come to my location



Just have a look People shared their experience







Rated him 5 star because very well mannered A C was turned on without I having to ask expert in navigating politely asked which route to take good driving

Though I had almost 90 positive experience with Uber but problems are growing fast

Uber marketing and quality assurance team should be added to this group or they are already here





Good experience with the driver







Dear Uber Bangladesh I have been using uber service since last 2 months For the first time i have encoutered with a rude and uncouth driver Let me take you to what he did to me Driver Faruk agreed upon to go to Square Hospital from Mohammadpur and came to pick me up accordingly Then after getting on the vehicle when i requested him to drop me inside the lane opposite to Square Hospitals he started to behave rude at once and told if i take him to any lane then me and my wife should get down at once Then i was angry too He was referring to other passengers to take him to alleys and this makes him difficult to maneuver his vehicle He was abusing other passengers and abusing uber as well He suddenly played his radio loudly without any permission Me and my wife got down at his preferred point and walked the rest Now my concern is why should i face such an unwanted situation Why should a driver of such standard have the audacity to behave like this After i complained to uber via app and rated him 1 star he called me from 2 different numbers and started abusing and threatening me I urge uber to cancel license of such a bastard or else i will lodge a complaint against the driver and uber bangladesh I was a fan of uber and was planning to register my personal car with uber But the such an incident is making me think twice Here is the driver details Name Faruk His uber phone 8801711141976 His personal anusive phone 8801990880000 I have also attached the screenshot of his call history You can ask grsmeenphone to send you the send younthe conversation record Awaiting your response Saadman Khan Nabil Business Manager ACI Logistics Ltd Shwapno Level 8 Novo Tower 270 Tejgaon I A

Wish me luck

I got this driver today He was really polite and drove safely after a long time i gave someone 5 star He took the route suggested by uber which was moghbazar to mohakhali brac university via hatirjheel gulshan 1 Its comparatively long route Rather than if we took through satrasta the distance would have been short Now this there any way to complain about this route issue to uber







This is the first driver who did not ask my destination till start on the trip Feeling good This driver was very good Very experienced though he is very young I rated him 5

Can I get uber at early 5 am

This is an incident of an Uber user in Delhi Be alert



Uber connect this driver i am at bangshal al razzak hotel he s just near by i called him ask him to come over he started giving me excuses when i said i wont cancel y i wont cancel starting arguing with me Now this is the case do not have enough words to say anything more I did not cancel





Fell positive by using Uber first time

How safe is Uber in Dhaka for girls women travelling alone Any special considerations for safety Would love to hear experiences from females who have traveled alone





Any weekly promo offer going on right now

Now this is the case at first he argued with me to cancel the trip while he was just away from my pick up point Then he did not cancel the trip he did not pick me but put the trip on then 2 minutes later he cancelled How to take proper action against him

This guy did not come he puts the trip on adter few minute cancel the trip Now this is happening





anyone knows the bannani office location of uber ps help Thanks





Rated him 5☆ He was waiting for me about 30min didn t start the trip earlier AC was good I seriously doubt about his age how the hell he got driving license looks under 18

All the time we complain about the bad experiences that we get through UBER but today​ I want to share a good experience with my ride Loved the professional behavior from this driver so keep an eye for him







i never used uber is it mandatory to have a credit card to avail uber or any other payment option payment ki trip shesh e driver ke dite hoy uber use korar jonno mobile e internet connection thaka ki mandatory

Uber has gone crazy 😂😂😂 Two different fare estimate within 5 seconds 501 TK and then 466 TK Now on will try a few times to see if I can get a lower fare 😂😂😂😂

worst thing of UBER is the drivers most of them are new to city we ve to navigate them from back seat otherwise it s really helping a lot





wan na take first ride any promo code available

I don t understand why is every single UBER driver asking kothai jaben after ride request Is their map not working Happened to me on last 4 requests Anyone else facing this





As people normally post when they have a negative experience Let me post something positive Last Monday I took a ride from Dhaka University to IBA hostel and the driver refused the map instructions and went through a different one which led to us being stuck in traffic for 40 mins and also resulting in an extra fare of 35tk I complained and this is what I got back Top notch customer care service even if it is a bit slow and unconventional

I have used Uber service in 46 times most of the experiences were good You need to use the promo as much as possible without promo Uber is a bit expensive For long distance it may cost much but for Allion or Premio cars it s logical to pay that much amount If you don t like the cheap cars then cancel the request and search again Allion or Premio Uber cars are more or less available in everywhere



Would you please share your emergency contact number HELPLINE in case of unprofessional attitude by driver or any unwanted incident

this guy is threatening me to cancel the trip also saying that Uber told him to do that this guy is threatening me and blaming Uber about their policy



Respect to my math teachers Zero has a value after decimal

Rated Him 5☆ Gentleman Knows Dhaka very well he came to my location without any hassle Normally no UBER driver waits but he has no objections regarding waiting outside restaurant for long time AC was good He is a non smoker he rates low for people who smokes inside his car



Uber drivers should learn how to use the map At least 50 drivers don t follow map GPS to locate the passenger in pickup point No matter how many times you say just follow Map to my current pick up location

As a new user how can I get discount on Uber





Under payment section of my uber a c there are two options i e credits and promotion Which will use first

Before joining this group I thought Uber was one of the best things that could have happened to commuters in Dhaka After 50 plus rides my own experiences have been very positive But 80 of the posts here are negative Why

so far my uber experience is superb will be more cautious about issues discussed here in this group to avoid any bad experience this is very informative and helpful group good to be here





I would like to request our group member s to post your positive review s also with negative reviews this will help to balance reviews about uber in our country

I can select exact pickup location but I can to select exact destination Anybody can help me

What annoys me most about uber It is being operated by the Indians They clearly don t understand the situation on ground I hope they soon hire some Bangladeshis to understand how to function in the market

Car was mid 2005 with chilled AC driver was good he did well behaved with me my rating was 5 out of 5

So glad that we have uber in our country



New here Haven t used uber yet but I plan to How much money approximately will it cost to travel from Polton to Mirpur indoor stadium Any estimation would be appreciated

Used Uber tonight Uber charged more than the fare Segunbagicha to Kalabagan Upfront fare said it will cost 220 56 BDT But after the trip the fare was 385 BDT Don t know why this excessive bill even after the upfront fare What to do now

Does anyone know if Uber is coming to other cities like Chittagong Do you think it will be a good market for Uber







Can any one give me a Uber promo code its urgent

What s this





Counting down the days to Uber s dissolution in Bangladesh

I am an active member of this group After introducing Uber personally i benefited lot I really dont like to bargain with CNG or ride very rare Toma taxis Thats why I want continuation of this service in Dhaka city Everyday I saw lot of negative experience of rider here also some positive too I took more than 80 rides up to now I am so lucky that i never faced any cancellation or request of cancellation or extra charge or BOKSIS or faulty AC system or route changing But even then I am worried to hear other s experience Now a days before booking Uber I feel uncomfortable and think that may be i am going to face similar bad experience Thats why I want the betterment of Uber as well as a good competitor of Uber All the best

Is there anybody who is directly connected to Uber office BD Please do response it s urgent

Today after riding uber for merely a 8 5 km trail they charged me for 12 5 km culminating a final fare of 470 taka with 175 tk discount 》295 tk Moreover their initial fixed price was 300 tk without any discount My question is even if i followed the same path as indicated why they charged me more according to a longer route And how can I submit a tailored complain to them After initial search i can see that they ve only few selective topics there without any option to write a letter

5☆ Chilled AC Good behavior Except He was out of fuel we had to stop near tejgaon CNG gas pump





There are so many people working for Uber employee here but none of them admits or has updated their current employment status Why this hide and seek Are you afraid of the legal consequences or rage of the suffered people Take pride in what you do Chill



Using uber in middleEast for a long time and it has beaten the local taxis due to excellent service they provide 0 complaints Why so much from Bangladesh Look this is not uber s fault Its how people use mis use the system PERIOD



Is there any option in Uber for advanced booking I mean if I want a ride on next day but want to request today If yes then how



driver said he needs gas and will only go to mohakhali side he also asked my destination

This upfront fare is shit and confusing Just now I put Mirpur to Khilgaon in both my and my sisters Uber app My fare shows 301 tk and my sisters 488 tk What is the benchmark of this system really

Today i called a car from Siddheshawari to Banasree The driver was at Bashabo When he heard that i m at Siddheshawari he told that it ll take time due to traffic for pickup I told him that i ll wait Then he said he will not come to Siddheshawari from Bashabo to pick me I told him that he is bound to pick me up He replied that he ll not travel this distance to pick me i can do whatever i want So i asked him to cancel the request he rudely declined that also Throughout the whole conversation his behavior was very rude It seems like he is doing some favors to me Later on i lodged a complain through the app This is the 3rd time that i have faced this type of problem Previously Uber people replied that they will ensure that this will not happen again they ll look into this matter I just want to know about the action taken by Uber after a complain has been lodged by the user through the app

Took a ride today in the morning to my Uni from Uttara I paid tk 170 including 40 discount The upfront fare was tk 286 Which otherwise could have been 21 10 210 50 26 3 338 So perhaps due to low demand of cars i got a much lower fare than the regular one at that time However still didn t get my receipt at the mail yet

Ok so they made this upfront fare system good stuff Today I traveled from Bashundhara to Kochukhet The upfront fare was 307 TK excluding promo The driver made some poor judgement and traveled some extra miles maybe 3 4 My bill came as 430 after applying the promocode What the actual f ck just happened Is it like they are going to apply upfront fare when its profitable but underneath apply the regular billing system when the upfront fare is no longer profitable Its the driver s fault why he circled around the wrong roads but I got off at the exact point where I set my destination Then there are those complaints about Uber selecting longer routes after introducing the upfront fare Uber is making a total mess in this region

I dont know why does it show a single price whearas it was used to show range nd if its actually fixed then i think it should be fixed what so ever



How to Avoid Bad Uber Drivers If you have encounter an Uber Driver that you never want to ride with again then rate them 3 or fewer stars and you will never be matched with them again

i am surprise to see this in my mail even though i did not ride this trip due to deny by driver which i mentioned it last post

how to complain all this matter by using uber app

now i am this position for 10 min need a car badly



driver name habib cell 880 1787 737035 just rcvd request and deny to ride say have some trip mistakenly he rcvd request and deny to cancel trip what can i do now



Completed 10 rides with Uber So far the experience is really good Atleast we dn have to argue with stupid arrogant cngwalas anymore about the fare destination Thanks for bringing something really useful good to our lives Happy UBERing

Have they scrapped the upfront fee process now Got billed like this at 11 30 PM tonight

My trips with Uber in Delhi Jan 2017 Service of Uber was excellent in Delhi Uber even go less 1km in Delhi and they have so many option I used total 21 times





I have received a message about 40 discount but did not get any discount on next ride screenshot attached

For the first time got in a car from Dhanmondi where the driver refused to turn on the AC with the usual Gas Sesh excuse Never found any driver like this before especially since I call a lot from Basundhara R A Will I get any refund from the complain I made for this trip Would have cancelled but it was late so got in anyway 😐



Ac is not working driver is claiming in morning another driver used that car for trip as it is his first trip on evening he don t know about ac problem Though at first he was claiming ac was working when i told i will complaint then he told the story Is it really true Same car can be driven by two drivers



As per the experiences shared by some fellow UBER users that no matter weather I follow their suggested route or not the fair they fixed will be same Now my question is say I have requested for a ride from new market to mohakhali and continue my ride up to uttara Then what will be the fare

I enjoyed UBER serive 4 times in a day I have 4 types of experience Two 2⃣of them won t on their AC when I asked them one 1⃣has on his AC and another told me that he has poor gas then I asked him why u are in the road go to gas pump ⛽ then he on his AC Another one asked me where I will go I reply him why you asked me the destination as his rules never comply him to asked destination Then he told me that sir whenever I am going to offline ur phone catch me then I told him to go offline instantly Otherwise experience is not bad but I will request to UBER management to trained the Driver and give them some examplary punishment along with Award on the baais of their activity So that UBER can earn the confidence of Rider thanks 😌

Uber upfront fare and uber suggested route ki correlated

I want to go somewhere now how will i get a uber car or cng



















Just I was trying to connect Uber from Dhanmondi road 2 I was seeing so many uber cars near there But Uber app connected a car for me which was so far instead of near one Frequently I am facing this problem

What s this credit about

I was informed one driver can accept ride request if he within 2 3 km radios my opinion it should be within 1 km as our traffic conditions there should be some xplaing options when a rider click to cancel the trip Today when I seen car serial no Start from 11 I did not contact the driver just cancel the trip







This Driver do with my family just cheated This time also going on promo but he told after 3 pm not allow promo it is true

I need to know is the payment facility while using UBER Is it possible to pay in hand cash







Yet again I am proved below 4 star drivers suck This guy is 3 8 star and I gave him 1 star and complained to uber At first he said he would be late to my location even though he was in the road adjacent to my residence road After trip over he argued that he deserves more than the amount paid As a regular uber user I explained that the amount is correct First time ubr users will fall for this Avoid him if possible Name is Riaz drives a blue Axio 37XXX301 phone no 01682861162

Did Uber give any new promotion code for this week

can t use Uber using wifi network from last week Had to turn on cellular connection to use it cleared cache uninstalled reinstalled didn t help anyone else faced this problem to triangulate location turning on cellular data is not mandatory and i have taken more than 20 trips using wifi network

I wonder if some Uber Dhaka officials are here and enjoy our posts 😁😁😁 Uber is josh when it only gives discount 😍😍😒 First 50 upto 200 taka Now 45 upto 170 taka p

I have a complain about their discount policy Few days ago I send a request to my sister for using uber and she get discount for first 3 rides When she ask the driver how to use it driver said that he doesn t know this producer What is this If you suggest the people to use your service and you send the SMS for discount then why you don t help the people Please provide the proper service or stop this kind of fake SMS





Nice journey that was Curious mind want to know about the discouts how come



probably uber saved me with its upfront system this time trip time was around 2 hours 15 minutes still costed me the same as the app shown before probably because I did follow the app shown route strictly driver himself told that in normal case it should cost me around 700 if the upfront was not there I could change my location and make the trip under 1 30 hrs maybe but the charge would be either high or same as the app shown 500 bdt 174 was for promo code so the bill is 325

I traveled to Bashundhara R A from Shantinagar this evening At first I looked for a uber ride and was offered a fare around 550 tk which seemed insane So I took a CNG which cost me 330 tk on meter and took me about one and half hours Given that the traffic was very high at that time I could easily use a rickshaw and travel there for about 140 180 tk I ve traveled many times there with this rate and still could reach in 1 hour Clearly on high traffic hours Uber with upfront system and CNG doesn t give any advantage in time and cost saving IMHO rickshaw is better because it takes similar or lesser time fare is also much lesser and not to mention rickshaw rides are more enjoyable





✌✌✌

I didn t Try Uber Yet So I ve some questions 1 From One place to another There is always both the longest and the shortest route If uber s map or driver Wants to follow the longest One what should i do cause longest route will cost more fare isnt it 2 Can i choose My own route if not then what will i do if i need any emergency 3 after calling a driver can i cancel my trip if i do so what ll be the procedure 4 in the mid way if i am to stop my trip or change the destination what ll be the procedure TIA



Uber is on D

Now at ds point Wth so many complains against Uber I think they need to stop their operation Fix da flaws and then reoperate rather than ruining their reputation We don t want any old problem CNG in a new package With a new name



Today from 10 30 I am trying to open uber app but only showing LOADING but didn t load not only today it s happened several times mainly when I am trying from my home indira road





There you go



What promo code can we get tomorrow 😭😭



this is my first post in the group i live in uttara sector 10 i havent used uber yet but twice in last few days i ve tried it and both the time it said currently no vehicle available in my area has this ever happened to anyone else please share thnx

I had two uber rides today First one I strictly followed the map showed by uber and got the same fare as well For the second one i went further than the destination Uber charged me like the old method I think uber is ok prodblem is in bad gps signal You can easily instruct drivers according to your preferred route and uber will charge you depending on the time distance

Nothing Changed I called UBER last evening Check the screenshots The Driver didn t pick me and took another trip to uttara It is now becoming a regular practice of UBER driver to refuse anyone if the destination is not on the line of his choice See the screenshots

I wan na know how I can join I have already registered

Assalamualaikum Is uber service down I have been trying to avail Uber for the last 3 days but havnt been able to find a driver

If you complain to uber about wrong route uber will definitely help you They will give your money back I faced a problem like this and the refund me 100 credit

This driver was so well behaved that for once I thought he was the owner himself Really well behaved He drove a brand new Toyata Voxy Amazing ride Wonder why he has 4 65 🙂



Noticed something about ourselves We Bengalis prefer to ruin everything good that comes about us If you look at the Freelancing market Upwork isn t allowing new accounts from here and instead suspending old accounts gradually why We cheated and provided extremely low class jobs Uber is having hard times maintaining quality why Our people drivers prefer money over everything else even if that ruins their own future I wonder will our mindset ever change What will that cost if we ever achieve so

Can somebody tell me about the passenger rating of uber Also how can we check that











Official Twitter account and Facebook page of uber are used for promotion purpose only Online promotion department and customer care department of uber are totally separate Online promotion department doesn t forward any support request to customer care department If you face any problem while requesting a ride or during a ride or fare related issue contact uber support only through Uber App installed in your phone

Do Uber Bd has any official page on facebook where they response to our query

I failed to add my CC in payment section Only I am the person who is facing the issue CC City Bank Visa

What is the rate breakdown for Uber Per km Per minute Base fare I got unfare billed and need to verify those Even the most funny part is I took 2 rides with same car The 2nd time though the ride was near in terms of km and time the fare was much high then the 1st time I just can t match here what happened Check the screenshots below I calculated the fare considering 21 taka per km and 3 taka per minute This could be wrong if the fare is updated but how can a less distance route can bill high than long distance route Please check the screenshots details with time and distance ANd I need to know how and where can I complain about this There phn is off and I don t have any direct email address 1st ride http prnt sc eikhlo 2nd ride http prnt sc eikgn3







After this ride I can not request any new ride now showing only map now request option Ki korbo

is this necessary for me to get my 300tk as referral credit that the person who rides for the first time must use my promo or if they can use my promo after using GET50PERDHK as their 2nd or 3rd ride TIA

I just checked my rating and it is 4 15 I have rated the worst of the drivers 5 5 and this is unacceptable How do I dispute this





Uber has certainly gone CRAZY Why would I take this route at this time of the day If they want to keep the upfront fare system like this at least they should provide the option to take alternative routes

SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT UBER REGISTERED DRIVERS 1 They are from USA seriously they use google map to find out thier own home 2 Curiosity level dam too high regarding destination as if rider going to rob him 3 Jungle trained behavior 4 Serious IT EXPERT knows how to switch off Mobile after reaching your destination 5 Psychic Pokemon Power GPS Internet both goes out under his command Lastly all our fingers are not equal all UBER Driver are not same Some are really good And UBER doesn t care about bad n ugly ones They are here for business Thats why we have this group for UBER USER AWARENESS



Map s showing there are cars available but cant connect to them Is the server down Tried for 15th time





Dear riders this how uber works now so please take a peek at it in order to avoid confusions and issues about your trips



To whom it may concern

Okay there s something that s been bothering me since last night 3rd March I called for a ride from Farmgate to Uttara I was with my girlfriend I got off at the airport and asked the driver to take the fare from my girlfriend I also instructed her to check the driver s phone to be sure about the fare as there was a 150 45 discount Anyway last night after a ride I was checking my ride logs and saw that the fare of that ride was only 105 TK after discount I checked the receipt It is showing the trip time is 33 minutes which is correct but the distance is wrong Only 1 32 Miles It should be around 10 miles May be the GPS didn t work and also the driver didn t pay attention to the fare and distance He was a very good driver and friendly person I was late for my train He help me with my luggage drove precisely I am just feeling bad that he won t get the money he was supposed to from this ride Is there any way for me to let Uber know about that Any kind of help will be appropriated Thank you

Anyone can explain me please what is the credits





I just check see what they are showing A car is just near to my building but uber shows 16 min will required to come my place I think uber apps has some problem or they are just cutting customer s pocket to earn more

cant pay my dues and not able to request new ride bcoz of that if uber can not process my dues from my credit card why did they accept it while I was registering bcoz of their poor system why should I suffer

Uber failed to assign car after long time waiting I ve canceled but now when I am trying again they show me this message





Happiness is seeing a lot of Uber cars around your location

Is it a glitch or a trick I was going to banani from farmgate why uber map is showing I have to turn left and back through Bijoy Sarani Why should I pay for extra 500 meters

Yesterday on 9 march at around 6 pm i sent a ride request from Paltan vip road near to scout bhaban some driver accepts my request when i called him then he told me that he was at near kamalapur station and so many jam and request me to cancel the trip i did and sent another request accept another driver he told me he was Dhaka university and many jam request to cancel i did sent another request accept same driver from DU and i cancelled the trip and sent another request accepted driver at shantinagar bazar i get the ride Can anybody tell me how far a driver can accept ride request from pickup point If any driver accept the request faraway from my request point how to cancel the trip by driver



What is the new system or fair policy of Uber can anyone explain

Does this really work in bd





Why is Uber showing me the free ride amount in dollars instead of taka Is it the same for all others now

Took a ride today with mum Driver was swearing incessantly at bystanders to cng drivers He lost his temper entirely by the time we reached to our destination I actually think Uber should give the drivers some kind of training on anger management 🙄🙄🙄





Uber authority should be more careful in the time of recruiting uber drivers naively speaking some drivers r more polite and courteous but some r arrogant stupid talkative short tempered thats why 90 problems has arisen for their misdeeds as a well wisher of uber i think uber authorities take fruitful initiatives to stop drivers misbehave

Can anyone help me understand how uber works right now I knew that when i request an uberx the most nearby car gets the notification After the driver accept that I can see that my ride is something minutes away Am i correct Today i had to go to birdem from moghbazar on an emergency basis I requested uberx and later i saw my ride is at begunbari After around 5 mins i called him to know is there any traffic jam ahead him he said madam ami ashte parbona ami onk dure apni cancel kore den When i asked about traffic jam he replied ha ha onnnk jam I was such an hurry that i couldnt made him to cancel the trip rather than i had to cancel it Now i want to know if he couldn t come then why did my request went to him















Only if uber had known even in a traffic stricken city like Dhaka upfront fares would fail 😂😂

I am really worried about Uber recent service You can easily understand how Uber is going to make frustration to its user This is only because of their unjustified new registered driver I am now 80 sure this service will be packet soon only for these blustered drivers I am sure some conspiracy is going against Uber and result already you see At Least 6400 member of this group can feel it If I can get any number of Uber official then I can warn them I dont know how to help them to understand current situation I request all of members here raise your voice and make Uber understand that this stupid driver will sink UBer which we general people dont want Thanks

This is the first time I m seriously pissed off with the driver I m riding with This guy is so rude and arrogant What do you do if you feel insecure and unsafe about a driver you re riding with





What is the latest bill calculation policy for Uber It used to be 21 per KM and 3 taka per minute 50 but now the fare seems different According to this receipt my trip fare excluding discount should ve been 50 4 18 21 13 3 176 78 But the receipt is showing 213 95 Has Uber changed their rate If so then what is the current rate

Instead of a short way UBER shows me a way which is 2 km more than the short way and fare comes more Now the fare is also fixed So what is the remedy

I think this is a good platform where we can share our experience and learned lot But this is also important to raise the negative incidents happening here I am sure some of Uber official are also member of this group In my view uber introduction is a revolution here We must let them continue in Dhaka city If we share then worse driver will terminate from Uber We dont know may be these bad drivers are may be part of bad ill motives of those who dont want Uber here We should all come forward to have a super duper Uber service system thanks













In my last two trips Uber has charged me higher They charged me the rate that was shown at the beginning of the the trip as estimated fare have they introduced fixed price or what The figures don t add up and there is no breakdown given of the total fare

Today I faced problem with two uber service 1 After calling he said that he can t come cause My place is too far from him but he didn t cancel the trip even didn t reach my call 2 Second one is after receiving call saying that He was coming it was still 26 mins left for his journey I don t know how to rate them but it s really pity that I have missed my appointment just because of two of them







Cant understand whata the problem



After launching Uber in Bangladesh they are doing pretty good with some challenges like car availability in certain places few old model cars etc Hope they are working on those issues and will overcome very soon But the most unfortunate issue is the behavior manner of few drivers which are creating real pain for the users like us For example 1 They are not ready to go in every location of Dhaka city 2 When they don t want to go If I request them to cancel the trip they said they can t cancel the trip or why should they cancel it as i request I had to cancel this this driver in the pic denied to go in the mentioned place and the also denied to cancel the trip and when I insist him that Uber drivers can cancel the trip also as far I know Then he told me that he will cancel the trip after 5 mins and he was so rude and without finishing the conversation he cut the phone This so annoying 3 Once I had to cancel the trip so many times as drivers didn t cancel the trip and as I had an emergency I had to search for another options After cancelling it few times I couldn t use the upper service for a few hours bcause uber app didn t allow me to do further requests Same thing happened with me few times My point is if drivers are not willing to go in the mentioned destination then they should cancel the trip and they should maintain a certain level of manner while communicating with the users This is so frustrating and annoying I think Uber should acknowledged those points and take necessary action for this kind of manner less drivers Because end of the day we are ready to pay for better service but not ready to accept bad behavior from those particular drivers

Driver refused to come and he is not cancelling the ride He asked me to cancel but i did not cancel yet I left the place took a CNG instead What to do S

Mr Maula was a well behaved and a very good driver He is driving a probox but the Air conditioning of his car is on point

Uber needs to tell all the newly recruited drivers that payment can be taken in both cash and cards form I have had quite a few situations lately where the driver had no clue that I can pay via cards This invariably leads to awkward situations for both the rider and the driver as they need to confirm with Uber after completing the ride and the rider has to wait until they confirm it

Is there any way to book a ride in advance say booking ride one day ago of the ride I need to go hospital on a regular interval fixed date to check up purpose of my family members Expert comments please



Has anyone paid through card Though my card details are already added it automatically takes cash option Please suggest if there is any step to be followed for making payments through cards

It was first time pleased their service hope it will continue with the best



Go to payment option then promotion and add Moniri23ue as promo code You will get 100tk discount on your first 3 rides Till now this the best you can get Uber has closed their 250 tk discount offer So enjoy your ride

hey sorry if its a dumb ques i downloaded the app and signed up what are the best possible offers i might get and how TIA

First time but good service

First time Good service

Update 02 Some days back i said i would open an website where we all could make a database of those bad driver with name Car Number which will help us to avoid those driver in the road http uberbd info soon i will complete the website Previous Post https www facebook com groups 320429561676636 permalink 369395140113411





It s very good to see people are sharing their experience with Uber on this page frequently which is a great platform for Uber to know it s service quality But I wonder if anyone from Uber Management is linked with this page Because if Uber pay no attention to these feedbacks especially the bad experience ones people may lose interest soon to share experience and stop expecting a good service from a quality promising service Uber First of all Uber is an app based service which is very time saving But at the same time as it is a no Management office interactive service it creates lot of issues like confusion for clients to hear different regulation ideas from different drivers misbehaviour deny or pick up issue and so on There are option for report and rating but question is where is a client s satisfaction after an issue with Uber Money is not going to be charged or Your feedback has been recorded can not be the only resolution People are using Uber specially for their service Where is that service guarantee or an action that makes the client happy and gives the trust back on Uber after a bad experience I know we get an email after a report but I am sure many will agree with me that Reports are going up day by day WHERE IS THE FORMAL RULES AND REGULATION PUBLISHED BY UBER SO THAT BOTH CLIENTS AND DRIVERS KNOW THEIR DOS AND DON TS I m a frequent user of uber but tremendously annoyed at the service recently I am using it for 3 4 months now but service was not this bad initially Common issues are a 90 of the drivers don t have location area knowledge of Dhaka City even major roads So clients need to navigate them constantly starting from call request b These days the drivers ask about drop off location first and then decides to go Recent issue is they ask first where to go and then deny with no gas and traffic excuse Traffic is nothing new in this country I believe only the client has the right to decide to wait or change mind to call for next one not the driver So basically comes down like cng service how badly people need to bargain for destination and money c When a driver refuses to pick up and the client warns him about reporting for his refusal the driver says he doesn t care So behaviour is a huge issue too d Different drivers say different rules about Uber Few say no ride after 9pm so he must be paid extra Few say they can control the travel route whichever way they want to Few say they have the right to choose or deny pick up Anyway I understand uber must have done it s research and development plan before starting their service in a quality of service unknown country like us If anyone from Uber Management gets to see this my humble advice is please try to focus on existing quality of service A country like Bangladesh inherits a nature where people prefer GET THE JOB DONE ANYHOW over quality But I believe we need to change this attitude especially a foreign organisation like Uber has much to contribute to initiate this change A WEEKLY BASED SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR DRIVERS AND OWNERS IS SUGGESTED IN DOING SO We have a mindset in our country that people who can not effort car are not rich so they use uber That s why it s not that important to meet the service quality But I know it s wrong Many rich people are using uber for quick convenience And it s not very cheap either Most importantly it s a service for educated people who know how to use technology Regardless of poor or rich uber should not compromise their quality of service like we experience in other countries of the world Because people use Uber for better service and don t mind paying extra Uber should secure that trust Thank you

How do I make a suggestion to Uber

Car is available but showing request Failed tried several times then showing the will not charge for the trip Ami to trip e nilam na charge kore Kemne Global service becoming Bd service

I was very much satisfied with their service previously but what happened on 24th night that was really unprofessional and don t match with service profile We were looking for a ride around at 9 40pm from Azimpur to go to Uttara It is very common issue that cng and taxi drivers don t want to come to uttara at that time and as a reason they show they might not get another trip However when we tried via uber app one driver was connected after few minutes he called and said there is a huge traffic on the road so he can t come and requested to cancel the trip Though His location wasn t very far from the pickup point We trusted him and cancelled the trip After few minutes we tried again and surprisingly same thing happened Second driver was also close but he said it ll take 1 5 2hours to come to the pickup point as there are huge traffic on roads so again we cancelled the trip after his request After that we came outside in search of any kind of public transport and got shocked to see that both sides of the road were free no traffic jam no rush We became speechless I think the authority must be more careful about these issues otherwise one day these kind of activities might cause harm to their business Can anyone suggest me how could I communicate with the proper authority regarding this issue I m attaching the screenshots

today s uber experience 1st called for a ride panthapath to officer s club car was infront of b city so he called and said he is coming over to my place after 10 min i see trip is running already so i called him angrily asking about this and she nato nato bole call kete dilo a min after he called sir ride drop hye gese abar request den so i requested again and different car came getdhk200 er theke may be 1st tai kono bill ase ni but ami sure charge hyse and benefited hoise 1st car driver 2nd when i was coming back from officer s club i asked for uber again and 1997 corolla came how they allow such old model car gave out 1 star 1st time gave 5 star last 15 times driver was rude also but gave 1 star for the car model only

Hi everyone Sharing my first ride with uber Yesterday I book Uberx around 6 27pm from Uttara sector 13 to Gulshan 1 So I called the driver and told him my pickup location in details Felt like he was bad with navigation The time I book it was showing 05min distance but he arrived around 12mins later Also there was some problem with his device When I reach my destination I was charged BDT485 My first promo code did not worked Also later on when I checked my previous trip it was showing the time I booked 6 27pm the Uberx not the time I was picked up 6 38pm That means the driver intentionally press the picked up button from his end to charge me extra Also my first promo code did not worked For Uber welcome to Bangladesh but a long way to go I am worried about our nature we do not keep good things good Enjoy uber ride everyone and be aware

Around 10 pm everyday all the Uber car drivers give excuses when asked to go from Kolabagan towards Mirpur Very strange If Uber is like using CNG wherein the mood of the driver is the main factor and not the convenience of the customer then I don t see a point of it being available 24 hours in Dhaka and also apart from using the airconditioning and the seating arrangement of a car















Is there anyone here who s car is assigned to uber I need some advice



Any idea about customization of destination I m new in this I actually can not confirm the exact location but can confirm nearby location in map One more thing can route be customized on the way

I want to join Uber as a registered driver but I m not too sure about the security as what if the passengers mugs the s t out of me or hijacks the car Should I go for it





Here comes the hike 😕



bad news fare will be so high in this jammed city they should reduce the ride time fare at least

Can anyone confirm me whether they take more than 4 passengers in uber rides or not For example 4 passengers 4 kids

After operating just for 2 months 20 22 fare hike without any fuel price hike in the country might not be accepted in a positive way among the Uber users in Bangladesh Still it has lots to do to get acquainted with the clients Hope they will come up with new effective business ideas which will benefit all the stakeholders

Could i get free ride again If I use another new email 🚗

Is there any way to change the mobile number with which someone intially registered in case he lost the previous one or no longer using it how to edit that option I didn t find any edit option there

Took my First ride and 2nd to a Wedding Today First one was simply AWESOME D Got a brand new Premieo with all the wood interior and the driver was So chilzzz and cool D My parents were skeptic about Uber but even they were amazed when the fare was only 350BDT 100 BDT using promo code From Mirpur 1 Ahmednagar to Officer s Club O 2nd ride back meh not so much It was a probox with very shaky ride some issues with brake I guess With the annoying Traffic in Kaoran Bazar and Kalyanpur the total fare was 400 BDT But I will definitely use Uber over CNG from now on D If your office is in DOHS Banani and home at Mirpur then you should definitely use it via Cantonment D





I had a ride with Uber last night with the payment option as my credit card The driver drop me off at my destination and told me that my card will be charged for the fare Right after the ride I was having continues SMS of having insufficient balance on my card and as a result Uber could not charge me I called my bank and got to know that Uber is trying to charge from my card s USD portion Then I had to enable my USD option and paid the amount I was writing this to inform this group members if someone put his her card as the payment method it would charge from the USD not the BDT option

How can I be the driver of uber

Well the first experience was pretty good Tried one from Mohakhali DOHS to Aftabnagar Which was a free ride and that turned out to be a good one Later tried one to come back home from Aftabnagar Rampura but couldn ’ t find a car nearby the app gave me 4 5 drivers who were according to the app 9 mins away but they were mostly around Gulshan Mohakhali area Which was pretty much obvious considering the traffic I ’ m really hopeful about their service Looking forward to it

Well we all know UBER has started its operation in Bangladesh recently So this group will work as the platform for all the UBER users in Bangladesh to share their experience and queries regarding UBER It s an unofficial group where people can share their experiences only regarding UBER Any irrelevant post will be deleted and the responsible person will be removed

If anyone knows any representative of Uber please let me know have a lot of constructive feedback for them It is a good initiative but feel they have leaps and bounds to cover

First UBER experience in Dhaka and it was really satisfactory
