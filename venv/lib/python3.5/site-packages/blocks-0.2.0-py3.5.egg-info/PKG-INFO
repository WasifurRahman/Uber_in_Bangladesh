Description: Blocks
        ======
        Blocks is a framework that helps you build neural network models on top of
        Theano. Currently it supports and provides:
        
        * Constructing parametrized Theano operations, called "bricks"
        * Pattern matching to select variables and bricks in large models
        * Algorithms to optimize your model
        * Saving and resuming of training
        * Monitoring and analyzing values during training progress (on the training set
          as well as on test sets)
        * Application of graph transformations, such as dropout
        
        In the future we also hope to support:
        
        * Dimension, type and axes-checking
        
        See Also:
           * `Fuel`_, the data processing engine developed primarily for Blocks.
           * `Blocks-examples`_ for maintained examples of scripts using Blocks.
           * `Blocks-extras`_ for semi-maintained additional Blocks components.
