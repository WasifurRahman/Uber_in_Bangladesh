==============
pyAvroPhonetic
==============

A Python implementation of the popular Bengali phonetic-typing software
`Avro Phonetic`_.

Branch: Master: |Master| | Develop: |Develop|

Overview
========

pyAvroPhonetic provides a Python package that can be imported and used
by other Python programs or scripts. It implements the *Avro Phonetic
Dictionary Search Library* by `Mehdi Hasan Khan`_.

*N.B. This package is still experimental and is not (yet) fit for
production use.*

Inspirations
------------

This package is inspired from `Rifat Nabi`_\'s `jsAvroPhonetic`_. So
far, the code is a direct (and shameless) translation of
jsAvroPhonetic into Python.

Installation
============

Using Git:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/kaustavdm/pyAvroPhonetic
    $ cd pyAvroPhonetic
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Using Pip:

::

    $ sudo pip install PyAvroPhonetic


Usage
=====

At present only a subset of features have been implemented. When
implemented, the parser can be accessed as:

::

    >>> from pyavrophonetic import avro
    >>> avro.parse('aami banglay gaan gai')
